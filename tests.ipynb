Hence, the relatively high SOC stocks observed in these sites (Figure 3 ) are more because of the contribution by the fallow vegetation and the absence of soil tillage.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 372, 'end': 392, 'text': '(Epron et al., 2009;', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 393, 'end': 416, 'text': 'Laganière et al., 2010)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF16'}], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 631, 'end': 632, 'text': '3', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}], 'eq_spans': [], 'section': 'RESULTS AND DISCUSSION', 'sec_num': None}, {'text': 'The construction of chronosequences for newly introduced J. curcas plantation systems did not reveal a clear SOC trend over 4 years.

Over all systems and sites, no differences between SOC stocks measured in 2010 and in 2011 were observed. These observations comply with the meta-analysis by Li et al.

In deeper soil layers, no significant SOC stock increase over time was observed. SOC concentrations exhibited patterns similar to those of SOC stocks (Figure 4 ). The SOC masses of the cropping sites averaged 2•7 kg m À2 and increased to approximately 4•0 kg m À2 under mature living fences. The linear relationship for the 0-20 cm soil layers corresponds to an SOC accumulation rate of 62 ± 23 g C m À2 y À1 . The increase was the highest for the top 10-cm soil layer. Expressed in SOC concentration, an annual 0•02% increase from the initial 0•84% resulted in an SOC of 1•2%. Assuming soil coverage of 1200 m 2 by living fences (400-m hedge fencing 1 ha with a mean width of 3 m), an SOC sequestration of 77 kg ha À1 y À1 can be expected. Over the period of 20 years, this accumulates to 1•5 t C ha À1 . With 6•3 Mg C ha À1 sequestered in the woody above-ground and below-ground biomass of J. curcas living fences over 20 years (Baumert, 2014) , the contribution of topsoil SOC sequestration to the total ecosystem C accrual was 19%. In comparison with annual cropping systems, such as maize and cotton where usually only the root biomass of ~0•2-0•3 Mg C ha À1 (Tiessen et al., 1998) remains in the soil, J. curcas systems have substantial returns of organic material to the soil through the annual leaf fall. In general, in perennial systems with less soil disturbance, organic matter decomposition is slowed down. Eventually, high litterfall rates coupled with low decay rates lead to increasing litter stocks (Martius et al., 2004) and soil-C sequestration over time (Lal, 2004) . The observed increase in SOC of living fence systems is in line with the findings of Soulama (2008) that show an SOC mass increase in the 0-20 cm topsoil layer from 2•3 kg m À2 in a cropping site to 3•7 kg m À2 under a mature J. curcas living fence in the northern region of Burkina Faso. The observed values are high compared with the rates reported in the literature, for example, a global average accumulation of 33•8 g C m À2 y À1 in forests (Post & Kwon, 2000) , 10-20 g C m À2 y À1 in Senegal under best management practices (Batjes, 2001) , and 20-40 g C m À2 y À1 in arid and semi-arid agroforestry systems according to the literature review by Nair et al. (2009) . The findings of a metaanalysis by Guo & Gifford (2002) showed that land-use conversion from crop to plantation might cause a soil-C stock increase of 18% (estimated at 26% by Laganière et al., 2010) . This is substantially below the value of 48% calculated for the presented case. However, the high value can be explained given the localized planting with dense spacing in J. curcas living fences (<1-m distance between trees). Even though the share of SOC accumulation in the total C sequestration potential of living fences was high (19% over a growing period of 20 years), soil C sequestration in dry lands plays a negligible role in reducing the global C emission gap till 2100 (Batjes, 2001; Smith, 2008) . The incentive for J. curcas management leading to increasing SOC should therefore rather be seen in raising site productivity and soil fertility.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 1159, 'end': 1174, 'text': '(Baumert, 2014)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF3'}, {'start': 1393, 'end': 1415, 'text': '(Tiessen et al., 1998)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF27'}, {'start': 1744, 'end': 1766, 'text': '(Martius et al., 2004)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF19'}, {'start': 1802, 'end': 1813, 'text': '(Lal, 2004)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF17'}, {'start': 1901, 'end': 1915, 'text': 'Soulama (2008)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF26'}, {'start': 2262, 'end': 2281, 'text': '(Post & Kwon, 2000)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF23'}, {'start': 2347, 'end': 2361, 'text': '(Batjes, 2001)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF2'}, {'start': 2469, 'end': 2487, 'text': 'Nair et al.

The observed shift of the δ 13 C signature to significantly lower negative values in the intercropping systems can probably be traced back to a thick weed (C 4 ) cover in the plantations.

Agriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state with 69% of the main workers engaged in the agricultural activities and 75% of the total reporting area is available for cultivation. Hill farming systems are dominated by small-scale and subsistence agricultural groups as about 89% of the landholdings in HP are constituted by marginal and small farmers (GoHP 2021). In comparison to larger and more financially oriented farms, these farmers have distinct land management goals and limits. Planting trees on farms helps farmers to satisfy their multifarious needs, which leads to increase in tree cover and thereby reducing the burden on existing forests. Being influenced by physiography, the climate within state varies greatly with some areas being warmed significantly during summers, while, some being covered with snow during winters resulting in the state being classified in four agro-ecological zones. In recent years, changing climate, population increase and decreased land holdings has called for the development of land use systems that reconcile agricultural production with the provisioning of ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation. Agroforestry provides end-to-end link between sustainability and profitability along with greater opportunities for the sustained productivity to tackle such problems. However, the adoption of agroforestry technologies depends on the edapho-climatic, socioeconomic status and farmer needs, and management is influenced by physical, demographic and institutional factors (Bayard et al. 2007) . Studies report that low lying areas of HP are highly exposed to the changing climatic conditions (GoHP 2012). Chamba district of HP is categorized by mountainous landscape ranging from 2000 feet to 21000 feet and is least explored for its agroforestry resources. So, keeping in mind the extent of exposure to climate change and the role of agroforestry in addressing the climate change effects, the study was carried out with the objectives of identifying the prevalent agroforestry systems (AFS) and to assess their carbon stock potential.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 317, 'end': 336, 'text': '(Gupta et al. 2017)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF22'}, {'start': 1888, 'end': 1908, 'text': '(Bayard et al. 2007)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF15'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'eq_spans': [], 'section': '', 'sec_num': None}, {'text': 'The present experiment was conducted during 2019-2021 at Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'eq_spans': [], 'section': 'MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'sec_num': None}, {'text': 'The findings revealed that five AFS were prevalent in the study area, viz. agrisilviculture (AS), agrihorticulture (AH), agrisilvihorticulture (ASH), silvopastoral (SP) and pastoralsilviculture (PS). Depending upon the functional components AFS can take numerous forms which are generally the result of primary needs of the society, topography, climate, edaphic conditions, biotic factors as well as economic aspects. The tree density and proportionate area under tree component in different systems varied from 50 (pastoralsilviculture) to 157 (silvopastoral) per ha and 0.20 (agrihorticulture) to 0.65% (silvopastoral), respectively. Among the prevalent AFS in the study area, the specific agricultural components consisted of Zea mays (Makki), Triticum aestivum (Kanak), Hordeum vulgare (Jau), Oryza sativa (Dhaan), Avena sativa (Jauvi), Capsicum annuum (Shimla mirch), Solanum lycopersicum (Tamatar), Solanum tuberosum (Baingun), Allium sativum (Lahsun), Coriandrum sativum (Ben), Brassica juncea (Sarson), Trigonella foenumgraecum (Methi) and Capsicum frutiscens (Pipli). In the present era when we are facing the adverse climatic conditions agroforestry in the form of traditional systems is cushioning our agroecosystems implicitly. The systems prevalent in the farmer field were mostly traditional having the higher proportion of forest species fulfilling the needs of the fodder, i.e. Grewia optiva (Beul), Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena), Ficus palmata (Dagla), Bauhinia variegata (Kachnar), Morus serrata (Toot), Prunus cerasoides (Paaja), Celtis australis (Khirak), timber, i.e. Toona ciliata (Tooni), Bombax ceiba (Semal), Melia composita (Drek), Dalbergia sissoo (Shisham), Punica granatum (Dadu), Tectona grandis (Sagwan), Celtis australis and fuel, i.e. Albizia chinensis (Black siris/Olha), Celtis australis, Leucaena leucocephala, Ficus palmata, Morus serrata, Grewia optiva, Bauhinia variegata, Pyrus pashia (Kainth) and Pistacia integerrima (Kakarsingi). However, with the changing scenario horti-based systems are being preferred by the farmers owning to the economic benefits, perennial nature, less management which also results in positive ecological benefits side by side. In the study area, various horti-based systems comprised Mangifera indica, Citrus limon, Litchi chinensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Psidium guajava, Carica papaya and Pyrus communis. Although, farmers are not much bothered about the climatic hazards as they are by the returns from the investment, so, if farmers can be motivated to adopt suitable agroforestry technologies based on their economic profitability and dual goals of raising farmer economy and addressing climate change can be fulfilled simultaneously. Topographically being hilly terrain, the conservation of the soil against erosion as well as stabilization of the farm bunds becomes important. Natural grasses retained on the farm bunds as well as adoption of the pasture based systems locally known as ghasnis, on the land left fallow is also of utmost importance. Major grasses present in the pasture based systems were Chrysopogon montanus, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris Forestry, Nauni, Solan (32°11′30\" to 33°13′6\"N and 75°49 to 77°3′30\"E), Himachal Pradesh. Three village panchayats were selected and from each panchayat 15 farmers were selected randomly comprised 5 farmers each from marginal, small and medium category. The AFS being practised by the selected farmers were identified on the structural and functional basis (Nair 1985) and named on the basis of the prime importance of the functional components.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 3526, 'end': 3537, 'text': '(Nair 1985)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF4'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'eq_spans': [], 'section': 'Identification of AFS:', 'sec_num': None}, {'text': 'For the estimation of biomass in the AFS, sampling was done by laying out the standard plots of 50 cm × 50 cm for herbage, 1 m × 1 m for agricultural crops, 5 m × 5 m for shrubs and 30 m × 10 m for the trees. For the biomass estimation of the herbage, agricultural crops and shrubs, the destructive method of sampling was used. In case of agricultural crops and herbage, the vegetation found within the sample plot was uprooted and the aboveground and belowground portions were separated and oven dried at 70 o C till a constant weight was obtained. For the estimation of shrub biomass, the shrubs were uprooted and the branches were categorized into different size classes. Three branches from each size class were selected to assess the oven dried weight of the branches which on multiplying with the number of branches in each size class gave the total oven dried weight. For trees, non-destructive method of biomass estimation based on volume equations was used (FSI 1996) . The aboveground biomass (AGB) of the trees was estimated as: where BEF, Biomass expansion factor. Belowground biomass (BGB) of tree was calculated by multiplying its AGB with a standard factor of 0.26 (Cairns et al. 1997) . Biomass carbon stock was calculated by multiplying the biomass with the standard factor 0.5 (IPCC 2003) . For the estimation of soil carbon stock, five soil samples, one from the centre and four from the corners, were collected from the depth of 0-30 cm from the sample plot laid to form a composite sample. Soil samples were then shade dried, grinded to pass through 2 mm sieve and stored in cloth bags for further analysis.

Among different AFS, the AGB production ranged between 19.79-38.40 Mg/ ha, which is in line with the AGB reported (4.58-70.91 Mg/ha) in the study area by several workers. The AGB reported is higher than that reported by Tiwari et al. (2018) , while, lower compared to the AGB reported by Gupta et al. (2017) and Panwar et al. (2022) in low hill zone of HP.

Maximum biomass under silvopastoral system may be ascribed to tree density contributing to more biomass production along with structural and compositional differences of the system as reported by Singh (2018) and Sharma et al.

However, important point to note here is that under pasture dominated system the carbon stock stored in soil was more as compared to vegetation carbon stock as can be seen from the higher soil:plant carbon ratio of 2.59 under pastoralsilviculture system.

Highest soil carbon density (36.78 Mg/ha) was recorded under silvopastoral system, while, minimum under agrihorticulture which was at par with the soil carbon density under agrisilviculture. Higher soil organic carbon in silvopastoral system may be due to the litter addition as well as decayed root material in the soil as compared to the other systems. Soil organic carbon is also influenced by litter quality, geographic location, land use and management. Systems which are relatively older and undisturbed have potential to store higher carbon (Panwar et al. 2022) which may be the cause behind the higher carbon accumulation in soil under silvopastoral system. Similarly, higher soil carbon pool was reported under silvopastoral (Goswami et al. 2014) in Himalayan region. However, the results were contrary to the findings of the Singh et al. (2015) CARBON STOCK POTENTIAL OF AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS 2021). Similarly, Goswami et al.

Agriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state with 69% of the main workers engaged in the agricultural activities and 75% of the total reporting area is available for cultivation. Hill farming systems are dominated by small-scale and subsistence agricultural groups as about 89% of the landholdings in HP are constituted by marginal and small farmers (GoHP 2021). In comparison to larger and more financially oriented farms, these farmers have distinct land management goals and limits. Planting trees on farms helps farmers to satisfy their multifarious needs, which leads to increase in tree cover and thereby reducing the burden on existing forests. Being influenced by physiography, the climate within state varies greatly with some areas being warmed significantly during summers, while, some being covered with snow during winters resulting in the state being classified in four agro-ecological zones. In recent years, changing climate, population increase and decreased land holdings has called for the development of land use systems that reconcile agricultural production with the provisioning of ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation. Agroforestry provides end-to-end link between sustainability and profitability along with greater opportunities for the sustained', 'origin_id': 'sharma2023', 'id': 0, 'shard_id': 0, 'num_shards': 1}, {'text': 'productivity to tackle such problems. However, the adoption of agroforestry technologies depends on the edapho-climatic, socioeconomic status and farmer needs, and management is influenced by physical, demographic and institutional factors (Bayard et al. 2007) . Studies report that low lying areas of HP are highly exposed to the changing climatic conditions (GoHP 2012). Chamba district of HP is categorized by mountainous landscape ranging from 2000 feet to 21000 feet and is least explored for its agroforestry resources. So, keeping in mind the extent of exposure to climate change and the role of agroforestry in addressing the climate change effects, the study was carried out with the objectives of identifying the prevalent agroforestry systems (AFS) and to assess their carbon stock potential. The present experiment was conducted during 2019-2021 at Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and The findings revealed that five AFS were prevalent in the study area, viz. agrisilviculture (AS), agrihorticulture (AH), agrisilvihorticulture (ASH), silvopastoral (SP) and pastoralsilviculture (PS). Depending upon the functional components AFS can take numerous forms which are generally the result of primary needs of the society, topography, climate, edaphic conditions, biotic factors as well as economic aspects. The tree density and proportionate area under tree component in different systems varied from 50 (pastoralsilviculture) to 157 (silvopastoral) per ha and 0.20 (agrihorticulture) to 0.65% (silvopastoral), respectively. Among the prevalent AFS in the study area, the specific agricultural components consisted of Zea mays (Makki), Triticum aestivum (Kanak), Hordeum vulgare (Jau), Oryza sativa (Dhaan), Avena sativa (Jauvi), Capsicum annuum (Shimla mirch), Solanum lycopersicum', 'origin_id': 'sharma2023', 'id': 1, 'shard_id': 0, 'num_shards': 1}, {'text': '(Tamatar), Solanum tuberosum (Baingun), Allium sativum (Lahsun), Coriandrum sativum (Ben), Brassica juncea (Sarson), Trigonella foenumgraecum (Methi) and Capsicum frutiscens (Pipli). In the present era when we are facing the adverse climatic conditions agroforestry in the form of traditional systems is cushioning our agroecosystems implicitly. The systems prevalent in the farmer field were mostly traditional having the higher proportion of forest species fulfilling the needs of the fodder, i.e. Grewia optiva (Beul), Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena), Ficus palmata (Dagla), Bauhinia variegata (Kachnar), Morus serrata (Toot), Prunus cerasoides (Paaja), Celtis australis (Khirak), timber, i.e. Toona ciliata (Tooni), Bombax ceiba (Semal), Melia composita (Drek), Dalbergia sissoo (Shisham), Punica granatum (Dadu), Tectona grandis (Sagwan), Celtis australis and fuel, i.e. Albizia chinensis (Black siris/Olha), Celtis australis, Leucaena leucocephala, Ficus palmata, Morus serrata, Grewia optiva, Bauhinia variegata, Pyrus pashia (Kainth) and Pistacia integerrima (Kakarsingi). However, with the changing scenario horti-based systems are being preferred by the farmers owning to the economic benefits, perennial nature, less management which also results in positive ecological benefits side by side. In the study area, various horti-based systems comprised Mangifera indica, Citrus limon, Litchi chinensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Psidium guajava, Carica papaya and Pyrus communis. Although, farmers are not much bothered about the climatic hazards as they are by the returns from the investment, so, if farmers can be motivated to adopt suitable agroforestry technologies based on their economic profitability and dual goals of raising farmer economy and addressing climate change can be fulfilled simultaneously.

Natural grasses retained on the farm bunds as well as adoption of the pasture based systems locally known as ghasnis, on the land left fallow is also of utmost importance. Major grasses present in the pasture based systems were Chrysopogon montanus, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris Forestry, Nauni, Solan (32°11′30\" to 33°13′6\"N and 75°49 to 77°3′30\"E), Himachal Pradesh. Three village panchayats were selected and from each panchayat 15 farmers were selected randomly comprised 5 farmers each from marginal, small and medium category. The AFS being practised by the selected farmers were identified on the structural and functional basis (Nair 1985) and named on the basis of the prime importance of the functional components. For the estimation of biomass in the AFS, sampling was done by laying out the standard plots of 50 cm × 50 cm for herbage, 1 m × 1 m for agricultural crops, 5 m × 5 m for shrubs and 30 m × 10 m for the trees. For the biomass estimation of the herbage, agricultural crops and shrubs, the destructive method of sampling was used. In case of agricultural crops and herbage, the vegetation found within the sample plot was uprooted and the aboveground and belowground portions were separated and oven dried at 70 o C till a constant weight was obtained. For the estimation of shrub biomass, the shrubs were uprooted and the branches were categorized into different size classes.

For trees, non-destructive method of biomass estimation based on volume equations was used (FSI 1996) . The aboveground biomass (AGB) of the trees was estimated as: where BEF, Biomass expansion factor. Belowground biomass (BGB) of tree was calculated by multiplying its AGB with a standard factor of 0.26 (Cairns et al. 1997) . Biomass carbon stock was calculated by multiplying the biomass with the standard factor 0.5 (IPCC 2003) . For the estimation of soil carbon stock, five soil samples, one from the centre and four from the corners, were collected from the depth of 0-30 cm from the sample plot laid to form a composite sample. Soil samples were then shade dried, grinded to pass through 2 mm sieve and stored in cloth bags for further analysis. Soil organic carbon density was calculated by multiplying % organic carbon with bulk density and soil depth and expressed in Mg/ha. C (Mg/ha) = Soil bulk density (g/cm 3 ) × soil depth (cm) × OC (%) × 100 where C, soil organic carbon density; OC, soil organic carbon (%) expressed in decimal fraction. Vegetation carbon stock along with soil carbon stock was expressed as total carbon stock of the system.
