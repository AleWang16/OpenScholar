However, the adoption of agroforestry technologies depends on the edapho-climatic, socioeconomic status and farmer needs, and management is influenced by physical, demographic and institutional factors (Bayard et al. 2007) . Studies report that low lying areas of HP are highly exposed to the changing climatic conditions (GoHP 2012). Chamba district of HP is categorized by mountainous landscape ranging from 2000 feet to 21000 feet and is least explored for its agroforestry resources. So, keeping in mind the extent of exposure to climate change and the role of agroforestry in addressing the climate change effects, the study was carried out with the objectives of identifying the prevalent agroforestry systems (AFS) and to assess their carbon stock potential. The present experiment was conducted during 2019-2021 at Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and The findings revealed that five AFS were prevalent in the study area, viz. agrisilviculture (AS), agrihorticulture (AH), agrisilvihorticulture (ASH), silvopastoral (SP) and pastoralsilviculture (PS). Depending upon the functional components AFS can take numerous forms which are generally the result of primary needs of the society, topography, climate, edaphic conditions, biotic factors as well as economic aspects.

Among the prevalent AFS in the study area, the specific agricultural components consisted of Zea mays (Makki), Triticum aestivum (Kanak), Hordeum vulgare (Jau), Oryza sativa (Dhaan), Avena sativa (Jauvi), Capsicum annuum (Shimla mirch), Solanum lycopersicum", "retrieval next text": "(Tamatar), Solanum tuberosum (Baingun), Allium sativum (Lahsun), Coriandrum sativum (Ben), Brassica juncea (Sarson), Trigonella foenumgraecum (Methi) and Capsicum frutiscens (Pipli). In the present era when we are facing the adverse climatic conditions agroforestry in the form of traditional systems is cushioning our agroecosystems implicitly. The systems prevalent in the farmer field were mostly traditional having the higher proportion of forest species fulfilling the needs of the fodder, i.e. Grewia optiva (Beul), Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena), Ficus palmata (Dagla), Bauhinia variegata (Kachnar), Morus serrata (Toot), Prunus cerasoides (Paaja), Celtis australis (Khirak), timber, i.e. Toona ciliata (Tooni), Bombax ceiba (Semal), Melia composita (Drek), Dalbergia sissoo (Shisham), Punica granatum (Dadu), Tectona grandis (Sagwan), Celtis australis and fuel, i.e. Albizia chinensis (Black siris/Olha), Celtis australis, Leucaena leucocephala, Ficus palmata, Morus serrata, Grewia optiva, Bauhinia variegata, Pyrus pashia (Kainth) and Pistacia integerrima (Kakarsingi). However, with the changing scenario horti-based systems are being preferred by the farmers owning to the economic benefits, perennial nature, less management which also results in positive ecological benefits side by side.

Agriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state with 69% of the main workers engaged in the agricultural activities and 75% of the total reporting area is available for cultivation. Hill farming systems are dominated by small-scale and subsistence agricultural groups as about 89% of the landholdings in HP are constituted by marginal and small farmers (GoHP 2021). In comparison to larger and more financially oriented farms, these farmers have distinct land management goals and limits. Planting trees on farms helps farmers to satisfy their multifarious needs, which leads to increase in tree cover and thereby reducing the burden on existing forests. Being influenced by physiography, the climate within state varies greatly with some areas being warmed significantly during summers, while, some being covered with snow during winters resulting in the state being classified in four agro-ecological zones. In recent years, changing climate, population increase and decreased land holdings has called for the development of land use systems that reconcile agricultural production with the provisioning of ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation.
