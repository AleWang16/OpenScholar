This study addresses the potential for the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in traditional and newly introduced J. curcas production systems. Five prevailing systems included interplanting with annual crops, intensely managed monoculture plantations, afforestation of abandoned cropland, plantings along contour stone walls, and traditional living fences.\n\nThe SOC was analyzed in 20 paired sites of 1-to 4-year-old J. curcas plantings and adjacent cropland. Paired sites with living fences involved a longer chronosequence with 15-and 20-year-old plantings. Additionally, the contribution of J. curcas to SOC sequestration was investigated by comparing the 13 C signature of the C inputs in four J. curcas sites with that of sorghum cropping.\n\nLinear regression analysis did not reveal a clear trend of SOC dynamics over time for the short-term chronosequences, nor could the isotopic tracer technique prove a contribution of 4-year-old J. curcas trees to the SOC stock. The 20-year chronosequence of J. curcas living fences exhibited a significant SOC increase of 62 ± 23 g m À2 y À1 . Considering soil coverage of 1,200 m 2 ha À1 by living fences (400-m hedge with a width of 3 m), 1.5 Mg SOC was sequestered. Also, changes in δ 13 C values indicated a contribution of C 3 -derived C to the SOC stock. These findings on traditional J. curcas systems indicate the potential of this biofuel crop for improving cropland soil fertility in the long run.\n\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role in soil-based environmental services, soil fertility, and the productivity of an ecosystem (Vlek, 2005; Bationo et al., 2006) . In West Africa, only little organic material is left in annual cropping systems for mulching because of low productivity levels, biomass burning in the field, livestock grazing, and biomass use for energy purposes or as construction material (Tiessen et al., 1998; Bationo et al., 2006) . On the other hand, soil carbon loss is accelerated by microbe-induced, termiteinduced, and temperature-induced rapid mineralization and decomposition rates of organic material and by leaching and erosion (Batjes, 2001) . The SOC concentrations in West African soils, inherently low in fertility and under increasing anthropogenic pressure, range only between 1 and 8 g kg À1 (Bationo et al., 2006) .\n\nThe shrub species Jatropha curcas L. has been recently introduced as a low-maintenance biofuel crop with cultivation hotspots in India, Zambia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Brazil, Mexico, and Ghana (Gao et al., 2011) , on the basis of its claimed potential to increase energy security while contributing to land rehabilitation (Francis et al., 2005; Jongschaap et al., 2007) and mitigation of CO 2 emissions. In Burkina Faso, where declining soil fertility represents a main threat to agricultural production (Vlek et al., 2008) , the contribution of J. curcas cultivation to soil amelioration through increased residue inputs and erosion control could be significant. However, scientific evidence on land reclamation by J. curcas is scarce (Gasparatos et al., 2012) . Experiments carried out so far show evidence of improved soil structure and potential for C sequestration in degraded soils in a 30-month-old J. curcas plantation (Ogunwole et al., 2008) and increased soil-C stocks in J. curcas hedgerows as opposed to neighboring fields (Soulama, 2008) . Long-term soil-C sequestration rates of J. curcas systems are not known.\n\nStudies of long-term changes in soil C in the same location are rarely feasible because of the long-term follow-up required. Therefore, comparisons of soils under plantations with those under previous land use and under plantations of different ages are valuable methods for the detection of SOC change due to afforestation. The latter \"space-for-time substitution\" approach implies a soil chronosequence as a series of soils that develop in similar geological positions with comparable site factors except plantation age [Jenny (1980) cited in Richter & Markewitz, 2001] . Stable C isotope studies can furthermore help to detect subtle SOC changes due to the contribution of trees to soil organic matter in systems where the 13 C signature of the C inputs from afforested plots (C 3 plants) is different from the 13 C signature of the previous land use with C 4 plants (Nyberg & Högberg, 1995; del Galdo et al., 2003) . Our study aimed to quantify the SOC dynamics in J. curcas systems as opposed to annually cultivated cropland (i) by means of comparing paired J. curcas-cropland sites in a chronosequence approach and (ii) through application of the 13 C natural abundance technique, where the land-use history allowed 13 C discrimination.\n\nOn the basis of an inventory of J. curcas cultivation systems in Burkina Faso (Hallensleben, 2011) , soil samples were collected in five existing systems (Figure 1 ).\n\nIn south-western Burkina Faso, in the Sudanian agroecological zone (AEZ), J. curcas was introduced in small-scale, lowinput intercropping systems in 2007, including annual crops, and in larger-scale, more intensely managed plantations. These sites were predominantly characterized by shallow (53 ± 7 cm) ferric lixisols, with sandy loamy texture in the topsoil and clay content increasing with depth (see Appendix S1 of the supporting information). Afforestation in the south-west also occurred on very shallow (<40 cm) leptosols and endoplinthic ferric lixisols containing over 20% of ferruginous gravel. Sandy loamy in upper horizons and more clayey with depth, these soils are particularly poor in plant-available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and, because of low productivity, abandoned from agricultural activities several years before J. curcas planting. Within the Sudano-Sahelian AEZ, living fences of J. curcas have been traditionally planted to protect farm fields from animals. The hedges contain J. curcas shrubs of varying age (due to self-propagation), growing on 120+-cm deep lixisols with a sandy or silt-loamy texture. Further to the north, in the Sahelian AEZ, J. curcas has been planted since 2008 along the stone walls established against wind and water erosion. This area is characterized by >100-cm deep cambisols, clay-loamy in texture with clay content increasing in deeper horizons.\n\nThe average observed soil bulk density over all sites lies between 1•33 and 1•53 g cm À3 , typically increasing with depth. The soils are moderately to slightly acidic (pH 5•9-6•3) and are very low in plant-available P (2•2 ± 0•7 ppm) and low in plantavailable K (28 ± 4•9 ppm) (BUNASOL, 1990) . Total nitrogen (N) and C concentrations, ranging between 0•06% and 0•08% and between 0•76% and 1•04%, respectively, and decreasing with depth, also reflect poor soil fertility. The C/N ratio averaged 13•8 ± 0•7 (Appendix S1).\n\nAt 20 J. curcas sites, soil pits between the tree rows were dug to the bedrock or to a maximum depth of 120 cm. The soil profiles were investigated and classified on the basis of the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB, 1998) . In each of the horizons, three undisturbed soil cores were extracted for the determination of bulk density. Samples were also collected in 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, Figure 1 . Location of 20 paired Jatropha curcas-cropland sample sites in Burkina Faso. This figure is available in color online at wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ldr. and 60-100 cm soil layers for measuring SOC. Additionally, soils for the SOC analysis were sampled with a soil auger to a maximum depth of 60 cm according to the microsite sampling approach (Ellert et al., 2001) . The restriction of the sampling points to small microsites minimizes lateral variability and increases the precision in determining temporal changes in soil carbon (Ellert et al., 2001) . Thus, in two microsites (2 m × 2 m) per plantation, samples were collected at three points with an increasing distance from the tree stem (40, 120, and 200 cm) and bulked according to the sampling depth. This approach also aimed to account for differences in SOC caused by spatially variable rooting and leaf-fall patterns of J. curcas shrubs.\n\nAs reference sites, croplands in the immediate proximity of the J. curcas systems were sampled to represent the previous land use. These sites cropped with cotton, maize, sorghum, millet, and legumes (Appendix S1) were also sampled with a soil auger in two microsites to a maximum depth of 60 cm. However, soil auger sampling beyond 40-cm soil depth was hardly possible because of compacted or gravelly soil. The reference cropping sites next to contour hedges were protected by stone walls. The abandoned croplands in the vicinity of afforestation sites were not sampled because J. curcas plants survived poorly there; hence, no SOC accrual was expected. All samples were collected in the beginning of the dry period in October and November of 2010 and 2011.\n\nShort-term soil chronosequences were selected for introduced J. curcas systems in south-western Burkina Faso, covering previous land use (cropland) and plantations aged 1, 2, 3, and 4 years (Appendix S1). For traditional living fence systems in central Burkina Faso, the long-term effect of J. curcas could be investigated in a chronosequence of two cropland sites, representing year 0, and two J. curcas living fences aged 15 and 20 years.\n\nBy using the mass balance of stable 13 C isotope contents, the relative contribution of the new agroforestry system to SOC can be detected (Balesdent & Mariotti, 1987) . To this end, topsoil (0-20 cm) and plant (leaf) samples from four sites where J. curcas was established on land formerly cropped with sorghum were analyzed with respect to their 13 C signature (expressed as δ 13 C). Adjacent sorghum-cropped sites, representing the situation before afforestation, were also analyzed for δ 13 C. The proportion of newly derived C from J. curcas plots f new was calculated according to the mass balance equation (del Galdo et al., 2003; Christensen et al., 2011) :\n\nf new ¼ δ new À δ old δ veg À δ old\n\nWhere: δ new is δ 13 C of J. curcas, δ old is that of the reference sorghum soil, and δ veg is that of J. curcas leaves.\n\nTotal soil carbon and total SOC concentrations were analyzed by dry combustion with a EuroEA Elemental Analyzer. For SOC analysis, the soil was treated with 20% HCl beforehand. The analysis of δ 13 C was performed using a mass spectrometer (SerCon \"Callisto CF-IRMS\"). Prior to the analyses, all samples were dried at 103 °C for 24 h and ground to pass a 0•2-mm sieve. Soil bulk density (ρ b ) was computed as the ratio of water and gravel content corrected mass to volume (g cm À3 ). The SOC concentration (%) was converted to C stock (C t , Mg ha À1 ) for a fixed soil depth increment d (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm):\n\nC t ¼ SOC • ρ b •d\n\nCarbon stocks for the entire soil profiles were calculated by summing up the C stocks of individual layers down to the bedrock. Considering that ρ b can change over time because of crop choice and soil tillage, Ellert et al. (2001) recommended relating the SOC content to the unit of mass rather than volume. To account for unequal soil masses or densities among the sites, SOC was calculated in successive layers of a soil mass corresponding approximately to the soil mass of the depth increments (~14 g cm À2 for 10-cm increment). The thickness of the additional soil layer (T add ) required to attain the equivalent soil mass (M equiv ) was then computed according to the equivalent soil mass calculation proposed by Ellert et al. (2001) :\n\nT add ¼ M equiv À M layer ρ b\n\nwith M layer as the actual soil mass of a 10-cm increment.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using STATA (12•0). All datasets were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance. Least-square linear regression models were tested for significance. In case of overall significant results, differences between means were tested by pairwise comparison with Bonferroni adjustment. For the comparison among the cultivation systems, regression analyses were adjusted for nested design (J. curcas plantations nested in system).\n\nThe analyses were performed at p = 0•05 significance level. Mean values ± standard error (adjusted for nested design) are reported except when indicated otherwise.\n\nSoil Organic Carbon in Jatropha curcas and Cropping Sites The SOC stock to 60-cm soil depth ranged from 33 to 66 t ha À1 (50 ± 7•5) over all cropland and J. curcas sites with ~40% of the C residing in the top 20 cm. SOC made up 97 ± 0•7% of the total C pool with no significant variation among the systems. Average SOC concentrations lay between 0•73% and 1•01% across all sites and depths. Three-factorial linear regression showed significant overall effects of the system (for 0-20 cm horizon) and depth factors (Table I ) and their interactions (p < 0•001) on SOC concentrations. The inclusion of the age factor in the overall regression model did not show interpretable results because of the unbalanced data distribution (Appendix S1).\n\nOver all sites and systems, SOC concentrations significantly decreased with increasing soil depth, measuring 0•9-1•2% in the topsoil (Figure 2 ) and 0•2-0•5% below 60 cm. Testing the depth factor separately for each system showed a significant decrease in SOC over soil depth in intercropping systems. The depth effect was statistically insignificant for intensely managed plantations and associated cropland because of the high SOC variability observed in these sites. Living fences with their associated cropland sites, afforestation systems, and particularly contour hedges showed statistically insignificant variations in SOC concentration over sampled soil depths. The virtually constant SOC concentrations over the entire soil depth under contour hedges and stone lines indicate steady C stocks. SOC stocks to a depth of 80 cm in soils under contour hedges were higher than those in the other plantation systems, whereas the topsoil values were the lowest among the studied systems (Figure 2 ).\n\nAll recently established J. curcas sites showed somewhat lower SOC concentrations than the adjacent cropland. In contrast, SOC concentrations in mature living fences (15 and 20 years old) significantly exceeded those in the reference cropping sites, indicating C accrual following J. curcas planting.\n\nSignificant differences were detected among the systems for SOC concentrations in the top 20-cm soil layer (Figure 2 ). Contour hedges had significantly lower SOC values (0•61 ± 0•08) than living fences (1•19 ± 0•08) and afforestation sites (1•08 ± 0•11). Given the differences in soil types among these systems, the observed variations have to be at least partly attributed to the location-specific soil properties. Among the cropland sites (pooled for each corresponding J. curcas system), no significant differences were observed (1•01 ± 0•10), although croplands associated with the intercropping and intensely managed plantations showed mean SOC concentrations at least 1•5 times higher than those adjacent to living fences and contour hedges. Below the 20-cm soil depth, variations among the systems were not significant.\n\nTable I.

Multiple comparisons were Bonferroni adjusted.\n\nFigure 2 . Mean values of total soil organic carbon concentrations (SOC, %) as affected by soil depth for paired J. curcas-cropland sites. Intercropping system include 1-4-year-old plantings, living fence -15 and 20 year-old, contour hedge -2 and 3 year-old, intensively managed plantation -3 and 4 year-old.\n\nThe SOC expressed in mass per unit area (kg m À2 ) for the top 20-cm soil layer is shown in Figure 3 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Mean values and their confidence intervals (95%) of (a) total soil organic carbon stocks (SOC) in mass per unit area (kg m À2 ) and (b) in equivalent soil mass (Equivalent SOC) in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of paired J. curcas and cropping sites (J. curcas systems: IC -Intercropping system; LV -Living fence; CH -Contour hedge; AF -Afforestation system; IM -Intensely managed plantation).] . Living fences exhibited significantly higher SOC masses than all the other systems (p < 0•001), except intensely managed plantations. Among the reference sites, significant differences were only observed between sites next to living fences and contour hedges (p < 0•05). Calculating SOC according to the equivalent soil mass of 28 g cm À2 for the first 20-cm increment resulted in more homogeneous SOC among J. curcas systems. Only contour hedges still showed the lowest values (p < 0•05). SOC masses in intercropping and afforestation systems increased following the calculation of the equivalent soil mass because of high gravel content and, consequently, low density of these soils.\n\nIn agreement with the results on SOC concentrations, SOC mass of cropland soils was also higher than that in J. curcas plantations in all paired sites, except for living fences. The C decline following afforestation in the first years is commonly observed and explained by the soil disturbance during plantation establishment and a fast mineralization of the fresh litter (Epron et al., 2009; Laganière et al., 2010) . In the afforestation systems, most J. curcas trees died in the first years after planting because of soil constraints and lack of management. Hence, the relatively high SOC stocks observed in these sites (Figure 3 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Mean values and their confidence intervals (95%) of (a) total soil organic carbon stocks (SOC) in mass per unit area (kg m À2 ) and (b) in equivalent soil mass (Equivalent SOC) in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of paired J. curcas and cropping sites (J. curcas systems: IC -Intercropping system; LV -Living fence; CH -Contour hedge; AF -Afforestation system; IM -Intensely managed plantation).] ) are more because of the contribution by the fallow vegetation and the absence of soil tillage.\n\nThe construction of chronosequences for newly introduced J. curcas plantation systems did not reveal a clear SOC trend over 4 years. For some paired sites in the intercropping systems and intensely managed plantations, croplands showed higher SOC masses (p < 0•05) in the first 40-cm layer (Figure 3 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Mean values and their confidence intervals (95%) of (a) total soil organic carbon stocks (SOC) in mass per unit area (kg m À2 ) and (b) in equivalent soil mass (Equivalent SOC) in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of paired J. curcas and cropping sites (J. curcas systems: IC -Intercropping system; LV -Living fence; CH -Contour hedge; AF -Afforestation system; IM -Intensely managed plantation).] ). Over all systems and sites, no differences between SOC stocks measured in 2010 and in 2011 were observed. These observations comply with the meta-analysis by Li et al. (2012) indicating significant C stock changes only after 30 years following afforestation. C decline in the first years since afforestation is commonly observed and explained by the soil disturbance during plantation establishment and a fast mineralization of the fresh litter (Epron et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012) .\n\nIn contrast, the chronosequence consisting of cropland soil (0 years) and living fences aged 15 and 20 years showed significant but low linear correlation between SOC (R 2 = 0•38, p < 0•05) and living fence age in the top 20 cm. In deeper soil layers, no significant SOC stock increase over time was observed. SOC concentrations exhibited patterns similar to those of SOC stocks (Figure 4 [FIGREF1: FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Linear regression and observed data points of total soil organic carbon (SOC, kg m À2 ) stocks in the topsoil (0-20 cm) in Jatropha curcas living fences in the central region of Burkina Faso. Dotted lines indicate confidence interval (95%).] ). The SOC masses of the cropping sites averaged 2•7 kg m À2 and increased to approximately 4•0 kg m À2 under mature living fences. The linear relationship for the 0-20 cm soil layers corresponds to an SOC accumulation rate of 62 ± 23 g C m À2 y À1 . The increase was the highest for the top 10-cm soil layer. Expressed in SOC concentration, an annual 0•02% increase from the initial 0•84% resulted in an SOC of 1•2%. Assuming soil coverage of 1200 m 2 by living fences (400-m hedge fencing 1 ha with a mean width of 3 m), an SOC sequestration of 77 kg ha À1 y À1 can be expected. Over the period of 20 years, this accumulates to 1•5 t C ha À1 . With 6•3 Mg C ha À1 sequestered in the woody above-ground and below-ground biomass of J. curcas living fences over 20 years (Baumert, 2014) , the contribution of topsoil SOC sequestration to the total ecosystem C accrual was 19%. In comparison with annual cropping systems, such as maize and cotton where usually only the root biomass of ~0•2-0•3 Mg C ha À1 (Tiessen et al., 1998) remains in the soil, J. curcas systems have substantial returns of organic material to the soil through the annual leaf fall. In general, in perennial systems with less soil disturbance, organic matter decomposition is slowed down. Eventually, high litterfall rates coupled with low decay rates lead to increasing litter stocks (Martius et al., 2004) and soil-C sequestration over time (Lal, 2004) . The observed increase in SOC of living fence systems is in line with the findings of Soulama (2008) that show an SOC mass increase in the 0-20 cm topsoil layer from 2•3 kg m À2 in a cropping site to 3•7 kg m À2 under a mature J. curcas living fence in the northern region of Burkina Faso. The observed values are high compared with the rates reported in the literature, for example, a global average accumulation of 33•8 g C m À2 y À1 in forests (Post & Kwon, 2000) , 10-20 g C m À2 y À1 in Senegal under best management practices (Batjes, 2001) , and 20-40 g C m À2 y À1 in arid and semi-arid agroforestry systems according to the literature review by Nair et al. (2009) . The findings of a metaanalysis by Guo & Gifford (2002) showed that land-use conversion from crop to plantation might cause a soil-C stock increase of 18% (estimated at 26% by Laganière et al., 2010) . This is substantially below the value of 48% calculated for the presented case. However, the high value can be explained given the localized planting with dense spacing in J. curcas living fences (<1-m distance between trees). Even though the share of SOC accumulation in the total C sequestration potential of living fences was high (19% over a growing period of 20 years), soil C sequestration in dry lands plays a negligible role in reducing the global C emission gap till 2100 (Batjes, 2001; Smith, 2008) . The incentive for J. curcas management leading to increasing SOC should therefore rather be seen in raising site productivity and soil fertility.\n\nThe 13 C natural abundance technique revealed subtle shifts in SOC stocks that would be significant in the long term but that might not be detected by less sensitive, conventional methodologies of total SOC measurements (del Galdo et al., 2003) . However, consistent with the results on SOC content in paired J. curcas and cropping sites in recently introduced J. curcas plantations, the δ 13 C signature of young J. curcas stands did not show significant amounts of newly C 3 -derived soil C (Table II ). The observed shift of the δ 13 C signature to significantly lower negative values in the intercropping systems can probably be traced back to a thick weed (C 4 ) cover in the plantations. As weed can be a major source of soil organic matter and seasonal shifts in weed composition (proportion of C 3 and C 4 weeds) can occur, monitoring of the weed component would help to better understand the soil C contribution by trees (Diels et al., 2001) .\n\nIn traditional living fences with mature J. curcas plants, the δ 13 C values in 0-20 cm topsoil were more negative than in the adjacent sorghum fields, indicating a contribution of J. curcas to soil C. The newly C 3 -derived C amounted to 10% (f new ) of SOC and eventually contributed to the significant increase in SOC. The proportion of C 3 -C was particularly high in the first 0-10 cm soil layer. In a sparse plantation of >15-year-old J. curcas trees where a young J. curcas intercropping system was integrated (sampling site 11, Appendix S1), parkland trees and ancient C 3 vegetation most likely contributed to the highly negative 13 C values observed (Table II ). However, despite the observable trends, the overall analyses did not prove significant differences in δ 13 C values between the mature J. curcas and the neighboring sorghum sites.\n\nStatistically significant SOC accumulation over time could be observed solely in living fences, as these are the only systems existing over a long enough period in Burkina Faso.\n\nTable II.

Mean values ± standard error; f new : proportion of newly derived C from J. curcas plots (in the first two cases, no newly derived C could be observed).\n\nThe chronosequence study (covering 20 years) showed an average annual SOC accumulation of 62 g m À2 in the top 20 cm (48% increase over 20 years) under J. curcas living fences. This value was corroborated by observable changes in δ 13 C values, indicating a contribution of C 3 -derived C to total soil C. Even if no increase in SOC in the newly introduced J. curcas plantation systems could be discovered over the first years, long-term SOC accumulation can be expected on the basis of the high organic matter inputs through annual foliage deposition in contrast to annually harvested crop biomass. Longer-term measurements comprising standard soil analyses and 13 C natural isotope abundance should be undertaken in growing J. curcas plantations to investigate SOC changes over time. The equivalent soil mass approach is advisable for calculating SOC stock changes as the soils are characterized by high gravel content.\n\nIn J. curcas living fences, localized plantings with high tree densities, high litter production, and low soil disturbance led to comparably high soil C sequestration rates. These made an important contribution to the total C budget of the living fences. Thus, ignoring SOC changes would lead to an underestimation of the C sequestration potential. Although the contribution to climate change mitigation remains small from the global perspective, the observed SOC increases are locally important for enhancing soil productivity.\n\nCopyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

{"id": "dalland1993", "title": "The potential of alley cropping in improvement of cultivation systems in the high rainfall areas of Zambia. III. Effects on soil chemical and physical properties", "text": "A detailed study of the soil chemical and physical properties in seven-year-old alley cropping trial containing Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia congesta in Northern Zambia is described. There was a strong correlation between the maize yield and the total amount of nitrogen applied, both from prunings and fertiliser, suggesting that a major reason for the observed benefit from alley cropping, particularly with Leucaena, was due to an improvement in nitrogen supply. Leucaena produced significantly more biomass, and its leaves had higher concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and lower C/N and C/P ratios than did those of Flemingia. There was also evidence that the trees had a beneficial effect on other soil chemical properties; under the hedgerows, particularly those of Leucaena, there were higher levels of organic carbon, Mg, K and ECEC, and pH values were also highest.\n\nIt is suggested that higher levels of organic carbon in the alley crop treatments were responsible for the improvements observed in soil physical properties. Lower bulk density, lower penetration resistance, and a higher infiltration rate and pore volume fraction were measured in the alley crops, although there was no significant change in the soil water release parameters.\n\nA deteriorating effect of constant applications of nitrogen fertiliser on soil fertility was observed; as the level of urea application increased, there were significant decreases in Mg, K and pH, increases in A1 and soil acidity, and higher penetrometer resistance. These results highlight the urgent need for further research on biological methods of maintaining soil fertility.\n\nIn Northern Zambia, government policy in the last decade has promoted maize production by the small-scale farming sector through the use of hybrid varieties and imported fertiliser, both heavily subsidised by donors [Stromgaard, 1984] . However, reduction of these subsidies in 1990 caused many small-scale farmers, unable to afford inputs, to return to the traditional chitemene and fundikila systems of cultivation. Evidence is also emerging that maize yields are declining despite increased rates of fertiliser application. A possible explanation suggested for this is soil acidification by the fertiliser [Bolt and Holdsworth, 1987] . For these reasons, if maize production is to be sustained in the region, alternative methods of maintaining soil fertility other than the sole use of fertiliser need to be developed. Alley cropping was suggested as one possible solution to the problem, and research began in 1984 at Misamfu Regional Research Station, Kasama, to assess its potential. Previous papers in this series have described the results from a number of trials evaluating the potential of alley cropping to maintain soil fertility in both maize production systems as well as the traditional chitemene and fundikila systems that may include maize during their cropping cycle [Matthews et al., 1991 [Matthews et al., , 1992a [Matthews et al., , 1992b]] . Results so far have not been encouraging; most trials showed a decline in crop yields in the alley cropping treatments after four years. It was suggested that this was a result of low tree biomass production, poor litter quality resulting in slow decomposition and nutrient release, and an inappropriate cropping sequence. However, in one trial lasting six years, it was found that Leucaena leucocephala, and to some extent Flemingia congesta, 1 consistently increased maize yields above the control treatment after initial amelioration of soil pH by liming [Matthews et al., 1992b] However, no significant changes in major soil chemical properties after six years of alley cropping could be measured, raising the question of how these yield increases were obtained.\n\nThis paper describes the results of a detailed study of the soil chemical and physical properties of the trial in its seventh year, with the aim of identifying factors contributing to the maize yield improvements by Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia congesta.\n\nThe trial (trial D31 in Matthews et al. [1992b] ) was located at Misamfu Regional Research Station, Northern Province, Zambia (10~ 31~ 1536 m above sea level). The mean annual rainfall is 1360 mm, falling between November and April, with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 18 ~ to 23 ~ Pan evaporation varies from 5 mm d -1 to 8 mm d -1. The soil, classified as an Orthic Ferralsol, is strongly leached and of low inherent fertility. Fuller details of climate and soil are given in Matthews et al.\n\nThe trial was established in 1984 as a split-plot design with four replicates. There were four main plot treatments (crop only, Leucaena leucocephala + crop, Sesbania sesban + crop, and Gliricidia sepium -tcrop) and three subplot treatments (0, 60 and 120 kg ha -1 N). Flemingia congesta replaced Sesbania in the second year due to the inability of the latter to withstand repeated pruning. Sub-plot size was 8 x 12 m, each containing four hedge-rows. Further details of the experimental design and management in the first six years (1984/85--1989/90 ) are given in Matthews et al. [1992b] . The current study was conducted during the 1990/91 growing season, and measurements were confined to the 'no trees', Leucaena, and Flemingia treatments, and replications I, III and IV. Although soybean was also planted in the trial, only the data for maize are presented.\n\nOn December 17, 1990, the trees were pruned to 40 cm height and the prunings incorporated into ridges at a spacing of 1 m. Maize (var. MM604) was sown into the ridges on December 19. Single superphosphate (SSP) and KC1 were appfied on January 21 at rates of 200 kg ha -1 and 40 kg ha -1 (17 and 20 kg ha -1 P and K, respectively) as a band along one side of the tree and crop rows and covered with soil afterwards. Nitrogen, as the sub-plot treatment, was applied in the form of urea only to the maize in two split doses, the first on January 21 and the second three weeks later. The urea was also applied by banding but on both sides of each maize row. A second pruning was made on January 30.\n\nBiomass production at each pruning was measured in the same way as that described in Matthews et al. [1992@ The maize was harvested on May 13, the cobs were allowed to dry in the sun, and shelled. A sub-sample of around 100 g was taken for dry matter determination; these were weighed, dried in an oven at 105 ~ for 24 h, weighed again, and the original sample corrected to 12% moisture content.\n\nLeaf samples were taken from the maize, Leucaena, and Flemingia at all levels of N fertilization twice during the growing season. Samples from the trees were collected at the time of the two prunings. Four trees were selected at positions, 3, 9, 15, and 21 from one end of each of the four rows in each plot, and the last fully-developed leaves from the two highest shoots were taken. Thus, the composite sample from each plot contained 32 leaves from 16 trees.\n\nMaize leaves were sampled on January 29 and March 15. Leaves were taken from four plants in each of the outer rows, with the same spacing as for the tree samples, and from eight plants in each of the two middle rows in each plot, again giving 16 leaves in each composite sample. In the 'no trees' plots, one representative sample was made of leaves from all six rows in each plot. At the first sampling, the uppermost fully-developed leaf below the whorl was collected, while for the second sampling (at the tasselling stage), the leaf immediately below the lowest cobs was taken. If no cobs had developed, leaves were taken from the sixth leaf from the bottom. This was only the case in the 'no fertiliser/no trees' treatment. Leaves were taken from different plants at each sampling.\n\nAll leaf samples were analysed at the chemical analytical laboratory at the Agricultural University of Norway. The nitrogen level was determined by Kjeldahl digestion, and P and K in the digested solution were measured by ICP. For C/N ratios, C and N contents were measured by infrared detection and thermal conductivity at 950 ~ for six composite samples from the\n\nLeucaena and Flemingia at the three N levels.\n\nSoil samples for chemical analysis were collected four times during the growing season (December 11, January 29, March 3, and May 24) using a standard 10 cm soil corer. Samples were collected from the furrows on either side of the middle maize row (defined as the 'M' position) at the 0--20 cm depth, and from the furrows between the hedgerows and the closest maize row (defined as the 'H' position) at 0--20 cm and 20--40 cm depths. Composite samples were made out of soil from two to three core holes for each position of the samples taken in December. In January, March and May, each sample consisted of soil from eight core holes. The holes were made at 1 and 5 m from the end at one side of the row, and with the same distance from the other end on the corresponding side. Samples were taken at least 30 cm from the core holes of the previous sampling to avoid interference of increased water and particle transport through the holes. A total of 63 composite samples were collected at each sampling date. With the exception of the December sampling, subsamples were taken from each fresh sample, placed in polythene bags, frozen, and sent for analysis of NO;-and NH + to Mt Makulu Central Research Station, Lusaka. The remainders of each sample were air dried, sieved through a 2 mm sieve, and placed in polythene bags prior to analysis at Misamfu. Methods of analysis of available Ca, Mg, K, P, soil pH, total N, organic C, and the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) are described in Matthews et al. [1992@ Soil mineral N was extracted with KC1; the NO3 content was analysed by reduction to nitrite by cadmium, and NH4 + by gas diffusion through a membrane into an indicator stream. The resulting color changes were measured by spectrophotometer.\n\nIn January, penetrometer measurements were made in the 'no trees' and Leucaena plots in the 0 and 60 kg ha -~ N treatments. A cone penetrometer [Klute, 1986] fitted with a No. 3 cone (3.5 cm 2) was used, although occasionally it was found necessary to use a No. 2 cone (2 cm 2) when the soil was very hard. In each furrow, four measurements were made at positions 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 m from each end of the row. In each plot, sixteen penetrations were made in the outer rows and sixteen in the middle rows, and readings taken from 0--10, 10--20, 20--40, 40--60, 60--80, and 80--100 cm depths in the soil profile.\n\nAfter the maize harvest, soil samples were collected from 5--50 cm depth for determination of bulk density, pore volume fraction, and the parameters of the soil water retention curve (pF). These were taken only from the 'no trees' and Leucaena treatments, both without N fertiliser. Using 100 cc cylinders, four samples were collected from the middle rows and four from the outer rows, at positions 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 6.5 m from the end of the row. The cylinders were taken to Mt Makulu Central Research Station, Lusaka, for analysis.\n\nWater retention capacity was measured at tensions of 0.0, 0.033, 0.1 and 1.5 MPa using a pressure plate apparatus [Klute, 1986] . Values for the parameters a and b of the soil water retention curve\n\nIn U s = a + b In |\n\nwhere U s is the soil water potential (MPa) and O s is the soil water content (%w/w), were obtained by fitting a straight line to the natural logarithmic transforms of each variable [Rogowski, 1972] . Bulk density and total porosity were also measured using the methods described in Klute [1986] .\n\nInfiltration rate measurements were made after the final harvest in the sole maize and Leucaena plots without N ferfiliser. Two holes, approximately 25\n\nx 25 • 25 cm in size were made in each plot, at positions 1.5, 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 m from the end of one row. The holes were filled with water to a depth of 15 cm, and the lowering of the water level measured at one minute intervals over a period of ten minutes. The process was repeated twice. The infiltration rate was calculated using the falling head method [Hvorslev, 1952] modified for use above the groundwater level.\n\nTotal prunings biomass production for the season is shown in Table 1 [TABREF0: TABLE Biomass production (kg ha -1) in each treatment.

This year, however, both alley cropping species also significantly increased yield even when fertiliser N was applied at the rate of 120 kg ha -I, an effect not evident in previous years.\n\nIn the tree leaves, the three nutrients, N, P, and K declined over the period of measurement (Table 2a ). In all cases, levels of each nutrient were higher in Leucaena than in Flemingia. There was no effect of applied N level on the leaf N% in each species, and no difference in the C%, either between species, or between N-levels (Table 2b ). Leucaena has lower C/N and C/P ratios than Flemingia, mainly due to the difference in the N% between the two species.\n\nThere was a general decline in all soil chemical properties over the season with the exception of NH +. Differences between treatments in the 20--40 cm\n\nTable 2a. Nitrogen, P and K content in Leucaena and Flemingia leaves. Values are %w/w.

There was a decline in NO;-to near zero over the period of measurement, and a corresponding increase in NH + over the same period (Table 3 ). Based on this data, there was a significant increase (P < 0.01) of total soil mineral N (to a depth of 40 cm) over the season from 60.8 kg ha -1 to 93.1 kg ha -1 N, a net increase of 32 kg ha -1. There were no significant differences between species, nitrogen level treatments, or sampling positions, for both forms of N, and no correlation between mean soil mineral N levels and the yield of maize. The total amount of nitrogen applied to each plot was estimated as the sum of that from the fertiliser and that from the prunings. Nitrogen fertiliser\n\nTable 3.

In the case of the prunings, only that N fixed biologically was considered, as the remainder originated from within the plot itself. The net contribution N from the prunings was therefore calculated as N applied = Prunings biomass X biomass N% X fraction of N fixed\n\nThe values for N% of 5.75% and 3.85% for the biomass of Leucaena and Flerningia respectively (Table 2b ) were used, and the fraction of N fixed biologically was assumed to be 35% for both species [Sanginga et al., 1989 ].\n\nThere was strong linear correlations between maize yield and N applied (Fig. 2a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2. (a) The relationship between total applied N (see text) and maize yield. Equation of the regression is Y = 574 + 10.2 X (r = 0.981, n = 9, P < 0.001); and (b) the relationship between total applied N and maize leaf N%. N% values are the mean over the January and March samples. Equation of the regression is Y = 1.52 + 0.0062 X (r = 0.968, n = 9, P < 0.001).] ), and between maize leaf N% and total N applied (Fig. 2b [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2. (a) The relationship between total applied N (see text) and maize yield. Equation of the regression is Y = 574 + 10.2 X (r = 0.981, n = 9, P < 0.001); and (b) the relationship between total applied N and maize leaf N%. N% values are the mean over the January and March samples. Equation of the regression is Y = 1.52 + 0.0062 X (r = 0.968, n = 9, P < 0.001).] ). From the gradient of the relationship between yield and applied N, it can be seen that each extra kg of N added produces a maize yield increase of 10.2 kg ha -1. If it is assumed that the N content of maize seed is 2.74% [Mengel and Kirkby, 1987] , this represents an efficiency of use of applied N of 28%. The increase in total soil mineral N accounts for 32 kg ha -1 of that not used by the crop, the remainder being lost from the system in some way.\n\nOrganic carbon. There was a decline in the soil organic carbon level in all treatments over the season (Fig. 3 ). However, particularly in the first part of the season, levels were higher in the Leucaena plots, and to some extent the Flemingia plots, compared to the 'no tree' control, although all treatments had declined to similar levels by the end of the season. There were significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) of organic carbon under the tree hedgerows than in the sole maize plots, but although levels were higher in the middle of the Leucaena alleys, differences were not significant (Table 4a ). There were also significant differences between the nitrogen treatments (Table 4b ), but these were not consistent --lowest values were in the N60 treatment and highest values in the N120 treatment respectively.\n\nPhosphorus. There was a general decline over the season in the level of P in the soil to around 36% of the value at the beginning of the season. There was a tendency for P levels to be higher in the Flemingia plots (Table 4a ),\n\nalthough not significantly, but there were no differences between levels of N fertiliser application (Table 4b ).\n\nAluminium and pH. Levels of A1 and exchangeable acidity (H + + 1[ 3+) were higher between the alleys in the Leucaena and Fleming& treatments compared to the sole maize, but did not differ significantly under the hedgerows (Table 4a ). Consequently, aluminum saturation levels followed a similar pattern. The highest values of pH were found under the Leucaena tree rows,\n\n1.20 1.10 1,00 O o \"E 0.90 0.80 o r 0.70 0.60 0.50 Dec i i i i J Jan Feb Mar Apr May Date of sampling Fig. 3.

When the pooled tree values were compared to the sole maize values, pH was significantly higher (P < 0.05) under the tree rows of both species, and significantly lower between the alleys. There were highly significant increases in exchangeable acidity, AP +, and aluminium saturation, and a decrease in pH as more nitrogen fertillser was applied (Table 4b ).\n\nExchangeable bases. Levels of Ca, Mg, K, Na, and the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) in the sole maize and rows with the Leucaena and Flemingia treatments are shown in Table 4a . In general, there were higher levels of each nutrient, resulting in the higher ECEC values, under the tree rows than between the alleys for each tree species. The ECEC was significantly higher (P < 0.05) under the hedgerows compared to the sole maize, principally due to higher levels of Mg and K. As increasing levels of nitrogen fertiliser were applied, there was a significant decline in the level of Mg and K in the soil (Table 4a ); however, as there was a corresponding increase in the level of H + and AP +, overall ECEC did not change significantly.\n\nThere were clear differences in penetrometer readings down to 50 cm depth, although at lower depths, differences were not significant (Fig. 4 [FIGREF2: FIGURE 4 Fig. 4. Penetrometer readings at each depth in the soil profile. O No tree-N0; O No trees-N60; [] Leucaena-NO; ~, Leucaena-N60; Vertical bar represents LSD0,05.] ). At both levels of N application, the Leucaena treatments showed less resistance than the 'no trees' treatments. Similarly, the treatments receiving 60 kg ha -1 N showed a higher resistance than those receiving no fertiliser, although where\n\nLeucaena was present, the difference was small. In the Leucaena plots, no difference was found between the middle rows and the outer rows.\n\nValues of the bulk density, pore volume, infiltration rate and soil water retention curve parameters are shown in Table 5 [TABREF7: TABLE Values of bulk density, pore volume fraction, infiltration rate, and water release parameters a and b obtained for 'no trees' treatment, Leucaena middle and outer rows.

Compared to the 'no trees' plots, there was a significant reduction in bulk density and significant increase in the pore volume fraction in the Leucaena plots, particularly in the rows near the trees. Infiltration rate was also higher in the Leucaena plots. There were, however, no significant differences between 'no-tree' and\n\n1800 0-1600 14oo 1200 ~ 100o O. floo 0 9 ;.-:,-,..\n\nThe extremely close relationship between the quantity of applied nitrogen and maize yield and nitrogen level in the maize leaves shown in these results (Fig. 2 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2. (a) The relationship between total applied N (see text) and maize yield. Equation of the regression is Y = 574 + 10.2 X (r = 0.981, n = 9, P < 0.001); and (b) the relationship between total applied N and maize leaf N%. N% values are the mean over the January and March samples. Equation of the regression is Y = 1.52 + 0.0062 X (r = 0.968, n = 9, P < 0.001).] ) emphasises the limiting nature of nitrogen in the soils of Northern Zambia. The beneficial results described in Matthews et al. [1992b] using alley cropped Leucaena leucocephala in comparison to Flemingia congesta and Gliricidia sepium, seem, therefore, to be largely derived from the capacity of Leucaena to introduce nitrogen into the system through biological nitrogen fixation. In comparison to Flerningia, Leucaena contributed considerably more N, not only by producing higher levels of biomass, but also by having a higher level of N in this biomass. The data in Table 3 indicate that there was a net increase of around 32 kg ha -* in the level of soil mineral N to a depth of 40 cm, mainly in the form of NH +, with no significant differences between either tree species, N treatments, or sampling positions. Why there should be an increase in soil N over the season at all in the sole maize receiving no N fertiliser is difficult to explain, although Yamoah et al. [1986b] also found that soil N level increased in control treatments, along with an increase of nearly twice as much under an alley crop of Cassia, a non nitrogen-fixing species. The y-axis intercept in Fig. 2a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2. (a) The relationship between total applied N (see text) and maize yield. Equation of the regression is Y = 574 + 10.2 X (r = 0.981, n = 9, P < 0.001); and (b) the relationship between total applied N and maize leaf N%. N% values are the mean over the January and March samples. Equation of the regression is Y = 1.52 + 0.0062 X (r = 0.968, n = 9, P < 0.001).] indicates the presence of residual soil N from previous years; assuming the estimates above are correct, and that all of this soil mineral N eventually becomes available to the crop, there appears to be an adequate supply without further addition for some time. The trial has involved a maize/soyabean rotation for several years, probably the factor responsible for the presence of N in the soil in the absence of fertiliser and pruning applications. The slope of the line in Fig. 2a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2. (a) The relationship between total applied N (see text) and maize yield. Equation of the regression is Y = 574 + 10.2 X (r = 0.981, n = 9, P < 0.001); and (b) the relationship between total applied N and maize leaf N%. N% values are the mean over the January and March samples. Equation of the regression is Y = 1.52 + 0.0062 X (r = 0.968, n = 9, P < 0.001).] indicates that only 28% of each additional unit of applied N is used by the crop; the rest is presumably lost by conversion to microbial protein or by leaching, as volatilisation on these acid soils is expected to be negligible. It is interesting to note that Fig. 2a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2. (a) The relationship between total applied N (see text) and maize yield. Equation of the regression is Y = 574 + 10.2 X (r = 0.981, n = 9, P < 0.001); and (b) the relationship between total applied N and maize leaf N%.

Equation of the regression is Y = 1.52 + 0.0062 X (r = 0.968, n = 9, P < 0.001).] in this paper is essentially the same as Fig. 2 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 2 Fig. 2.

[1992b] ; when applied biomass is converted to the nitrogen equivalent, differences in response between the different fertiliser nitrogen levels disappear.\n\nIn addition to improved nitrogen supply, an equally important effect of Leucaena alley cropping seems to be the improvement of soil organic matter levels. Similar increases in organic carbon were found when the results of several alley cropping trails at the same site were averaged [Matthews et al., 1991] . The role of organic materials in improving soil physical, chemical and biological properties has been well reviewed in recent years [e.g. Allison, 1973] , and various studies have shown the beneficial effects of alley cropping on soil organic matter levels. For example, Kang et al. [1981 Kang et al. [ , 1985] ] and Kang and Wilson [1987] , in a trial lasting six years in Nigeria, observed that soil organic matter levels were maintained in the alley cropping plots, but declined in the control plots. Similarly, Handawela [1986] reported higher soil organic matter and nitrogen levels under Gliricidia maculatum alley crops in Sri Lanka than under maize only. Yamoah et al. [1986b] found that there was an improvement in soil organic matter levels in Cassia and Gliricidia alley crops compared to the control plots. This improvement occurred even when the prunings were not applied, suggesting a contribution from root residues.\n\nThe beneficial effect of organic matter on soil physical properties is due in part to the action of organic gums in binding soil particles into aggregates, leading to an improvement in soil structure with a balanced distribution of pore sizes. This contributes to improved permeability and aeration, and easier root penetration, and in turn provides favourable conditions for development of fine feeder roots and mychorrhizae, so increasing the efficiency of nutrient uptake. The effects of improved soil physical properties on crop yields have been well reviewed by Lal and Greenland [1979] . As Yamoah et al. [1986a] have pointed out, good physical properties may even be more important than the supply of nutrients; the nutrients released from prunings become useless if the physical conditions do not favour proper root development to take up these nutrients. The present study showed significant reductions in soil bulk density, increases in the pore volume fraction and infiltration rates, and lower penetration resistance in the Leucaena treatments. Simlar results are emerging from other alley cropping studies. Handawela [1986] measured lower soil compression strengths under a Gliricidia maculatum alley crop in Sri Lanka, while Yamoah et al. [1986b] found a decrease in bulk density under alley crops of Gliricidia, Flemingia and Leucaena in Nigeria. Hulugalle and Kang [1990] , and Kang and Ghuman [1989] have observed similar improvements in soil physical proper-ties under various alley crops. Lal [1989b Lal [ , 1989c] ] reported that, despite an increase in bulk density and penetration resistance and a decrease in infiltration rates in all treatments, the rate of deterioration of these properties was less in Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepiurn alley crop treatments, particularly the former. This was attributed to effects on soil structure and structural porosity. The increased moisture retention capacity of the topsoil found by several authors [e.g. Kang et al., 1985; Yamoah et al., 1986b; Lal, 1989b] was not found in the present work.\n\nThe effect of enhanced organic matter levels on soil chemical properties has also been well documented. Factors such as a balanced nutrient supply, a slow release of nutrients, protection from leaching, and a buffering effect against soil acidity have all been cited [Young, 1989] . Certainly, in the present work, there were higher levels of Mg, K and overall ECEC, and pH values were also highest, under the hedgerows (particularly Leucaena) where organic carbon levels were the highest. Similar trends were reported by Kang et al. [1981 Kang et al. [ , 1985]] . Various other authors have also found evidence of an amelioration of A1 and acidity buildup by alley crops [e.g. Lal, 1989 @ Young [1989] has argued that it is unlikely that alley cropping can raise pH on naturally acid soils, but that further acidification may be checked by increasing the concentration of Ca and other bases in leaves brought up from the lower layers and recycled to the surface. The higher levels of Mg, K and ECEC in the alley crop treatments in the present study suggest that this may be occurring.\n\nThe higher nutrient content and lower acidity of the soil directly under the hedgerows suggests that litter fall and root residues are important factors contributing to soil fertility maintainance. Lal [1989b] also found lower soil bulk densities nearer the hedgerows, which he ascribed to enhanced earthworm activity and lack of soil disturbance. Nevertheless, despite the more favourable soil conditions, crop yields were significantly less closer to the tree rows [Matthews et al., 1991] , indicating that competition for light and possibly water may be more important than soil conditions.\n\nThe detrimental effect of constant applications of nitrogenous fertiliser is highlighted by these results. Significant decreases in Mg and K (and to some extent, Ca), increases in A1 and soil acidity, and higher penetrometer resistance were evident as more urea was applied. Lal [1989a] has pointed out that Ca, Mg, and K are often replaced by AP + under continuous cropping. Bolt and Holdsworth [1987] have reported a decline in maize yields in Northern Province, Zambia, despite increasing rates of fertiliser application, suggesting a deterioration in soil fertility as a possible reason. Certainly, urea is known to have an acidifying effect on soils [Mengel and Kirkby, 1987] . The decline in Ca, Mg, and K with higher fertiliser applications may have been due to the increase in maize yield removing more of these nutrients, emphasising the importance of balanced fertiliser applications. Adequate supply of one nutrient only may result in an induced deficiency of others.\n\nThus, although the high yields obtained with nitrogenous fertiliser application could not be obtained with alley cropping, the gradual deterioration in soil fertility, particularly in soil acidity, by the former, would seem to be a powerful argument in favor of continued research on alley cropping as a means of maintaining soil fertility and crop yields. While it is essential that other tree species should be screened for their ability to produce high quantities of biomass in the region, future research should also not discard Leucaena as a potential alley cropping species. Although the use of large quantities of lime is impractical at present for small-scale farmers in Northern Zambia IMatthews et al, 1992b] , the results from this trial have shown that Leucaena Ieucocephala seems to need favourable pH conditions only to establish; subsequent growth continues with no further applications even with soil pH as low as 4.4. It might be possible, therefore, to develop techniques of applying lime only to the soil around the seed or seedling, thereby reducing the quantities of lime required."}

We observed SOC content changes in a 16-year continuously cropped agroforestry experiment in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. SOC levels declined in all treatments. The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where SOC levels dropped from the initial 15.4 to 7.3-8.0 Mg C ha 21 in the 0 -12 cm topsoil in 16 years. In the two continuously cropped alley cropping (AC) systems, one with Leucaena leucocephala and one with Senna siamea trees, SOC levels dropped to 10.7-13.2 Mg C ha 21 . Compared to the no-tree control treatments, an annual application of an additional 8.5 Mg ha 21 (dry matter) of plant residues, mainly tree prunings, led to an extra 3.5 Mg C ha 21 (,0.2% C) in the 0 -12 cm top soil after 11 years, and 4.1 Mg C ha 21 after 16 years. The addition of NPK fertilizer had little effect on the quantities of above-ground plant residues returned to the soil, and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of SOC decomposition. The fact that both C 3 and C 4 plants returned organic matter to the soil in all cropping systems, but in contrasting proportions, led to clear contrasts in the 13 C abundance in the SOC. This 13 C information, together with the measured SOC contents, was used to test the ROTHC model. Decomposition was very fast, illustrated by the fact that we had to double all decomposition rate constants in the model in order to simulate the measured contrasts in SOC contents and d 13 C between the AC treatments and the no-tree controls. We hypothesized (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction on this site, having a sandy top soil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type, is lower than assumed by the model.\n\nImproved prediction of long-term changes of soil organic matter (SOM) contents in tropical soils should help identify more intensive and productive sustainable cropping systems. Because of the contribution of SOM to CEC, buffering capacity, soil structure, and water holding capacity, higher SOM levels could raise efficiencies of mineral fertilizers. A better understanding of long-term SOM dynamics can therefore significantly contribute to the current renewed research on the benefits of combining synthetic and organic sources of plant nutrients. Improved predictive capabilities moreover would allow for more precise assessment of the carbon sequestration potential in tropical soils.\n\nSOM models, if properly validated against long-term data, offer the possibility of estimating changes in SOM levels under current and improved cropping systems without initiating new long-term experiments. Unfortunately, only a limited number of studies (Woomer, 1993; Parton et al., 1994; Myers, 1995; Vallis et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2000; Gijsman et al., 2002) have tested SOM models against longterm data from tropical regions. Most if not all SOM models were developed using long-term data from temperate regions only. The particular mineralogy of many tropical soils and the lack of understanding of its influence on SOM stabilization (Merckx et al., 2001) , underscores the need for model validation using long-term data from the tropics, a task which is hampered by the limited availability of welldocumented long-term experiments.\n\nVarious types of experimental data have been used to test SOM models for temperate and tropical regions: (1) time series of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents (Jenkinson et al., 1994; Parton and Rasmussen, 1994; Vallis et al., 1996) , and ( 2) SOC contents at one particular time in sites/treatments which differ in one or another factor controlling SOC levels (such as quantity or type of the organic materials returned to the soil) (Parton et al., 1987; Paustian et al., 1992) .\n\nMany studies have used the 13 C natural abundance technique to generate quantitative information on long-term SOM dynamics in temperate and tropical regions (e.g. Martin et al., 1990; Veldkamp, 1994; Feigl et al., 1995; Hsieh, 1996) . The method, developed by Cerri et al. (1985) , is based on the fact that plants with a C 3 photosynthetic pathway have a 13 C abundance ranging between 2 24 and 2 34‰, while C 4 plants range between 2 6 and 2 19‰ (Smith and Epstein, 1971) . Because the 13 C abundance of incoming plant material is largely preserved during mineralization and humus formation, the 13 C content of the SOC reflects the 13 C content of the vegetation. If a change occurred from a C 3 to a C 4 vegetation or vice versa at a known time in the past, it is possible to infer the turnover time of the SOC originating from the first vegetation type from the present 13 C content of the SOM.\n\nThe possibility of using carbon isotope data as additional information for testing SOM models has been known since the work by Jenkinson et al. (1992) on changes in soil 14 C content following the nuclear tests in the early 1960s. However, very few researchers (Balesdent, 1996; Molina et al., 2001) have used 13 C abundance data in combination with SOM models. The use of the 13 C technique moreover has been limited to complete transitions from pure C 3 to pure C 4 vegetation (or vice versa). Tropical agroecosystems often involve a mixture or rotation of C 3 and C 4 plants.\n\nThe objectives of our study were to (1) monitor SOC changes on a 16-year time scale in a field experiment under sub-humid tropical conditions involving treatments with mixtures of C 3 and C 4 plants, (2) investigate the usefulness of the 13 C tracer technique for such a mixed C 3 -C 4 situation, and (3) use the experimental data to test the ROTHC SOM model (Jenkinson, 1990; Coleman and Jenkinson, 1995) .\n\nA field experiment was established in 1986 to compare a Leucaena leucocephala and a Senna siamea alley cropping (AC) system with a control system without trees.\n\nL. leucocephala is a fast-growing N-fixing legume tree, while S. siamea is a legume tree that does not fix N and grows less vigorously. Since 1986, the AC cropping systems and the control have been continuously cropped with maize during the first growing season (May -July) and cowpea during the second growing season (September -November), except for 1992 when the field was left fallow in the second season. The experiment was established on an Episkeleti-Ferric Lixisol (Chromic) (ISSS-FAO-ISRIC, 1998) on the experimental farm of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, SW-Nigeria (7830 0 N, 3854 0 E). The experimental field had a 6% slope. Farm records indicated that between 1975 and 1981 the land has been used for annual crops (maize, cowpea), and left under grass fallow from 1982 to 1986. The plot of land is visible as arable land free of shrubs or trees on aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 1979. Prior to the establishment of the IITA experimental farm in 1967, the land has been used by smallholder farmers, who presumably practiced a bushfallow system. Ibadan has a bimodal rainfall, with an annual mean of 1278 mm, and a mean annual temperature of 26.2 8C. The trial was set up as a randomized complete block design with five replications and six treatments: the above-mentioned three cropping systems with and without fertilizer. The experimental plots measured 19.5 £ 10 m. Yearly additions of urea (120 kg N ha 21 ), single super phosphate (40 kg P ha 21 ) and muriate of potash (25 kg K ha 21 ) comprised the fertilizer treatments. From 1994 onwards, these levels were decreased to 60 kg N ha 21 , 16.2 kg P ha 21 , and 15 kg K ha 21 . The trees in the AC systems were planted 4.5 m between the rows and 0.5 m within the rows at the beginning of the growing season in 1986, first pruned in 1987, and then regularly pruned 3-4 times a year. Tree prunings, excluding woody stems . 10 mm, were left on the plots. Tillage consisted of loosening of 3-5 cm of topsoil with a hand hoe prior to planting and at each manual weeding operation. Weeds were managed with a combination of a single herbicide spraying before each maize and cowpea planting and subsequent manual weeding (3 -4 times during the first season, twice during the second season). All weed residues were left in the plots. At harvest, the maize and cowpea residues were left on the plots. The only exceptions were that the 1986 maize residues were removed from the plots that received NPK fertilizer, and that the 1988 and 1989 residues were redistributed between all plots to obtain the same application rate in all plots (3.59 Mg DM ha 21 in 1988 and 6.15 Mg DM ha 21 in 1989). Full details of the management of this long-term experiment are given by Van der Meersch et al. (1993) for the 1986 -1990 period and Vanlauwe et al. (2004) ) for the 1986 -2002 period.\n\nSoil samples were taken in 1986 (0 -5 and 5 -10 cm depths, composite sample of 20 cores per plot), May 1997, and April 2002 (last two samplings at 0 -5 and 5-15 cm depths, composite sample of 24 cores per plot). The 1986 soil samples were sieved through a 2-mm sieve and analyzed for %C using the Walkley and Black procedure (Nelson and Sommers, 1982) . The 1997 and 2002 soil samples were sieved through a 4-mm sieve, ground with a ball-mill, and analyzed for %C and 13 C natural abundance simultaneously with a Europa Scientific ANCA-SL stable isotope mass spectrometer. 13 C natural abundance was expressed in d 13 C‰ units using the international PDB standard:\n\nEQUATION\n\nThe SOC content was expressed in Mg C ha 21 present in an equivalent soil mass of 1700 Mg ha 21 of mineral soil following the procedure outlined by Ellert and Bettany (1995) . Its equivalent thickness averaged 12 cm and varied slightly between sampling times and treatments due to bulk density differences. Bulk density values used in the calculations were derived from the same cores as used for the determination of the %C content to ensure consistency between %C and bulk density values used in the calculation procedure (Ellert et al., 2001) . Average d 13 C values were calculated likewise for the same equivalent soil mass.\n\nThe SOC contents and d 13 C values (1997 and 2002 data) were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA considering cropping system, fertilizer level, and their interaction as fixed effects and replicates (blocks) as a random effect (SAS Institute, 1992).\n\nAll crop and tree residue inputs were quantified throughout the experiment by weighing fresh residues on each plot and calculating the dry weight using the dry matter contents of subsamples (one sample taken per experimental plot). Carbon inputs (Mg C ha 21 ) were calculated using the measured average C contents of the respective plant residue types. Litter input from the roots in the top 12 cm were accounted for by multiplying (above-ground) residues of maize, cowpea and weeds by 1.10, Senna prunings biomass by 1.15 and Leucaena prunings biomass by 1.075. These factors were based on root:shoot ratios and information about variation of root density with depth reported by Jonsson et al. (1988) , Toky and Bisht (1992) , Schroth and Zech (1995) , Govindarajan et al. (1996), and Vanlauwe et al. (2002) . The factors do not account for root turnover, so true carbon inputs were likely slightly higher then estimated.\n\nThe area used for measuring the biomass production was the entire 19.5 £ 10 m plot for the tree prunings (four tree rows of 10 m length), and a smaller area for the maize stover (ranging from 6 £ 19.5 to 10 £ 19.5 m over the years). Cowpea residue input was quantified from 1993 onwards by measuring the aboveground biomass (excluding the pods) at the start of leaf senescence in one or two 0.5 £ 4 m frames per plot. Some biomass data are missing and were estimated. This was the case for the 1987 tree prunings and maize stover, the 1986 -1991 cowpea haulms, and the 2000 tree prunings. It was assumed that the biomass production of the Senna and Leucaena trees in 1987, i.e. the first year after establishment, amounted to 50% of the average yearly biomass production of 1989 -1991. The maize stover produced and applied in 1987 was taken as the average of the 1986 and 1988 production. As there were no data on the cowpea biomass yields for the years 1986-1991, the mean of the biomass measured for 1993-1997 was taken instead. The missing 2000 tree biomass was interpolated from the 1999 and 2001 data.\n\nWeed biomass measurements were taken in 1988, 1989, and 1990 by collecting all above-ground weed biomass in a 4.0 £ 1.5 m area in the middle of each plot at the time of the weeding operations (six times per year). Another set of weed biomass observations was taken in 1998 -1999 using a 0.5 £ 4.15 m frame randomly positioned in each plot. Weed biomass production rapidly declined from 1988 to 1990 and stabilized thereafter, as indicated by the fact that weed biomass production in 1998 was very similar to that in 1990. The missing weed biomass information for 1986-1987 and 1991-1997 was therefore interpolated from the available data using a negative exponential relationship with time.\n\nBall-milled plant samples of weeds, cowpea haulms, maize stover, and tree prunings from a selected subset of years were analyzed for 13 C natural abundance, and results were expressed in d 13 C units using the same methods as for the soil samples. Analysis of variance, reported by Diels et al. (2001) revealed that year-to-year variation of d 13 C values for these plant residues was so small that the information obtained from the selected years is representative for the entire duration of the trial.\n\nChanges in SOC levels and d 13 C were simulated using the ROTHC-26.3 model (Jenkinson, 1990; Coleman and Jenkinson, 1995) . ROTHC-26.3 is a model of the turnover of organic carbon in soils on a time scale of years to centuries. It allows for the effects of clay content, temperature, moisture content, and plant cover on decomposition. The model mimics decomposition by defining four active SOC compartments and a small inert compartment (IOM). The four active compartments are decomposable plant material (DPM), resistant plant material (RPM), microbial biomass (BIO), and humified organic matter (HUM). These four active compartments decompose following first-order kinetics, while the IOM compartment is resistant to decomposition. The effect of plant litter quality is handled by specifying how the carbon for a particular incoming material is split over the DPM and RPM compartments.\n\nLong-term averages of monthly mean air temperature, rainfall, and open pan evaporation for Ibadan were given as inputs to the model. In line with the practiced cropping system, it was specified that the soil was covered by a crop from May to November and bare during the remaining 5 months. The topsoil clay content was set to the observed value (9%). The DPM:RPM ratio was set to 1.44 for the maize, cowpea, and weed residues and to 0.82 for the tree prunings. As prunings consist of woody twigs (, 10 mm diameter) and easily decomposable leaves, we choose a value (0.82) intermediate between the 1.44 value recommended for improved grassland and agricultural crops, and the 0.25 value for deciduous or tropical woodland (Jenkinson et al., 1992; Coleman and Jenkinson, 1995) . Three sets of simulation runs were made: one with all decomposition rate constants set to the values fixed by the model authors (Coleman and Jenkinson, 1995) ; one with the DPM:RPM ratio set to 2.33 instead of the above-mentioned 0.82 value and all other rate constants and parameters left unchanged; and a third one with all decomposition rate constants doubled and all other parameters as set by the model authors.\n\nAs the present model cannot calculate changes in d 13 C in the soil carbon, we did 13 separate simulations to calculate the buildup of carbon derived respectively from the maize, cowpea residues, the first, second, third and fourth tree pruning, and the seven weeding operations within a year. The simulated buildup of 'new carbon', i.e. of carbon which entered the soil after the start of the experiment, was obtained by adding up the simulated SOC originating from each of these 13 plant litter inputs within a year. The d 13 C value of this 'new carbon' at a given time t was calculated as a weighted average:\n\nEQUATION\n\nwhere d 13 C i is the observed d 13 C value of plant material i and C i ðtÞ is the simulated buildup of plant-derived material i at time t. Isotopic discrimination during decomposition was hereby neglected.\n\nIn order to simulate the decline of the 'old' carbon, i.e. the carbon that was present in the soil at the start of the trial, the model was initialized by distributing the initially observed 15.4 Mg C ha 21 over the five model C pools. This was done by running the model first for the 5 years preceding the start of the trial according to two extreme land-use scenarios, the rationale being that type and quantity of organic matter entering the soil during the 5 years preceding the trial, essentially control how much of the initial 15.4 Mg C ha 21 must have been in the more labile DPM and RPM pools at the start of the trial. The land-use scenarios chosen for the 5 years preceding the trial were (1) continuous cropping with annual inputs of crop and weed residues amounting to 3 Mg DM ha 21 , and (2) grass fallow with annual inputs of 12 Mg DM ha 21 . The remaining C in the initial 15.4 Mg C ha 21 (the C that is not inert, and that did not enter the soil in the 5 years preceding the trial) was then allocated to the HUM and BIO pools according to a 1.0:0.003 ratio (a ratio representing a microbial biomass population in equilibrium with a decomposing HUM fraction according to the model rate constants). The size of the IOM pool, the inert SOC, was estimated with the regression equation proposed by Falloon et al. (1998) , which predicts an IOM pool size of 1.1 Mg C ha 21 for a SOC level of 15.4 Mg C ha 21 . To account for uncertainty on this estimate, simulations were done for two IOM sizes (0.3 and 5.0 Mg C ha 21 ), being the 95% confidence interval around the regression equation estimate.\n\nIn the model calculations we assumed that the treatments did not affect the decomposition of the old carbon nor its d 13 C. Therefore, contrasts in SOC levels between treatments are only dependent on the predicted buildup of new carbon. The model-predicted d 13 C of the SOC (old þ new) in 1997 and 2002 was calculated as:\n\nd 13 C\n\ntotal ðtÞ ¼ d 13 C old ðtÞ £ C old ðtÞ þ d 13 C new ðtÞ £ C new ðtÞ C old ðtÞ þ C new ðtÞ ð3Þ with C old (t) and C new (t) being the predicted contents of old and new carbon at time t for the given treatment, and d 13 C new (t) obtained through Eq. (2). Assuming absence of isotopic discrimination during decomposition, d 13 C old has the same value in 1997 and 2002. It was estimated by calibrating the model. By trial and error it was found that d 13 C old had to be set to 2 24.8 to bring the simulated d 13 C total in 1997, averaged over the six treatments, to the observed average d 13 C total . Again we focused most attention to d 13 C contrasts between treatments, as such contrasts are fairly insensitive to the size and d 13 C of the old C.\n\nThe quantities of organic matter (OM) returned to the soil are about twice as high in the AC systems (12.0 -15.4 Mg dry matter ha 21 yr 21 ) as in the control systems (5.3 -6.0 Mg dry matter ha 21 yr 21 ) (Table 1 ). Fertilizer amendments increased the quantity of maize residues and tree biomass, but decreased weed biomass. Combined, the fertilizer amendment led to a slightly smaller OM input in the control system and a slightly larger OM input in the AC systems.\n\nTable 2 [TABREF1: TABLE in the AC and control treatments Contribution from roots in the top 15 cm was estimated as 10% of the above-ground maize, cowpea and weed residues, 7.5% of the Senna prunings and 15% of the Leucaena prunings.Treatment means of d 13 C‰ values of maize stover, cowpea haulms, weeds, and tree prunings in the AC and control treatments <table><tr><td>System</td><td>No-tree</td><td>No-tree</td><td>Leucaena</td><td>Leucaena</td><td>Senna</td><td>Senna</td><td>95% Confidence</td></tr><tr><td>Fertilizer input</td><td>2NPK</td><td>þ NPK</td><td>2NPK</td><td>þNPK</td><td>2NPK</td><td>þ NPK</td><td>interval</td></tr><tr><td>Source</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Maize (stover þ roots)</td><td>1.4</td><td>3.0</td><td>1.8</td><td>2.6</td><td>2.1</td><td>3.6</td><td>^0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Cowpea (haulms þ roots)</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.0</td><td>^0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Weeds (incl. roots)</td><td>3.9</td><td>1.5</td><td>2.7</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>0.8</td><td>^0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Trees (prunings, litterfall þ roots)</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>9.2</td><td>10.9</td><td>7.8</td><td>9.0</td><td>^1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6.0</td><td>5.3</td><td>14.5</td><td>15.4</td><td>12.0</td><td>14.5</td><td/></tr></table>] lists the d 13 C values of the different litter inputs. The fraction of litter from C 4 plants is much larger in the no-tree control treatments (mean d 13 C ¼ 2 18.9 and 2 16.5) compared to the AC systems (mean d 13 C ranges between 2 24.0 and 2 25.0). The d 13 C values of the weed biomass are intermediate between the typical values for C 3 and C 4 plants. It indicates that a mixture of C 3 and C 4 weeds was present, with slightly more C 4 weeds in the control treatments than in the AC treatments. Moreover, d 13 C values of weeds varied between the seven weeding operations because of pronounced seasonal shifts in weed composition (proportion of C 3 and C 4 weeds) as discussed by Diels et al.

In this case it was again assumed the land was under grass vegetation producing 12 Mg DM ha 21 yr 21 during the 5 years before the trial began.\n\nThe simulated decline of the old C and buildup of new C over 16 years are depicted in Fig. 2 for the control and Senna AC system, both with fertilizer application. In both treatments, the model overestimates the SOC stocks in 1997, while the simulated 2002 stocks fall within the 95% confidence interval of the observations. For the no-tree control system, ROTHC predicts a steady decline in SOC levels (Fig. 2 ). Maize grain and stover production is low in All decomposition rate constants in ROTHC were doubled, while all other rate constants were left unaltered.

The old C, predicted to amount to 6.7 Mg C ha 21 in 1997 and to 5.1 Mg C ha 21 in 2002, was assumed to have a d 13 C equal to 224. 9‰, both in 1997 and 2002. a Average difference between the four AC systems and the two control systems.\n\nb Average difference between the two Senna AC systems and the two Leucaena AC systems.

A possible reason is that from 1982 to the start of the trial in 1986, the land was under grass fallow, and before that time cropping periods were presumably alternated with fallow periods, as is the standard practice on the IITA experimental farm since its establishment in 1967. Land use intensity has pronounced effects on SOC contents, and natural and planted fallows, including grass fallows, are known to be an effective way to restore SOC stocks (Lal and Kang, 1982) , because of the combined effect of the permanent soil cover, high returns of OM, and absence of tillage.\n\nWhile the reasons for the overall SOC decline are somehow speculative due to the absence of precise records on fallow practices, tillage methods and farm operations during the 10-20 years before 1986, comparison of the 1997 and 2002 SOC contents between the treatments gives clear information on the potential of options for SOC maintenance under continuous cropping. First, the data in Table 1 show that the crop residues indeed constitute an important source of OM but that there is little scope to further increase this by using mineral fertilizer. In the no-tree control treatments the SOC contents in the top soil dropped from the initial 15.4 to 8.5 -8.9 Mg C ha 21 in 11 years (Table 3 [TABREF2: TABLE Treatment means of observed SOC contents and d 13 C values for the 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass (,0-12 cm) in 1997 and 2002 for the three cropping systems at two fertilizer levels <table><tr><td>Cropping system</td><td>Mg C ha 21</td><td/><td>d 13 C ‰</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>1997</td><td>2002</td><td>1997</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control 2 NPK</td><td>8.9</td><td>7.3</td><td>222.3</td><td>222.6</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control þ NPK</td><td>8.5</td><td>8.0</td><td>222.4</td><td>221.4</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.3</td><td>10.7</td><td>224.4</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC þ NPK</td><td>12.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC þ NPK</td><td>13.4</td><td>13.2</td><td>224.6</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>SED a</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment differences</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AC-control b</td><td>3.5 ^0.9</td><td>4.1 ^1.4</td><td>22.29 ^0.35</td><td>22.47 ^0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC-Leucaena AC c</td><td>0.5 ^1.0</td><td>1.2 ^1.6</td><td>20.10 ^0.40</td><td>20.53 ^0.28</td></tr></table>] ), irrespective of whether fertilizer was added or not.

Compared to the no-tree control treatments, an annual application of an additional 8.5 Mg DM ha 21 in the AC treatments, mainly produced by the legume trees, led to an extra 3.5 Mg C ha 21 (, 0.2% C) in the equivalent soil mass after 11 years, and 4.1 Mg C ha 21 after 16 years (Table 3 [TABREF2: TABLE Treatment means of observed SOC contents and d 13 C values for the 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass (,0-12 cm) in 1997 and 2002 for the three cropping systems at two fertilizer levels <table><tr><td>Cropping system</td><td>Mg C ha 21</td><td/><td>d 13 C ‰</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>1997</td><td>2002</td><td>1997</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control 2 NPK</td><td>8.9</td><td>7.3</td><td>222.3</td><td>222.6</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control þ NPK</td><td>8.5</td><td>8.0</td><td>222.4</td><td>221.4</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.3</td><td>10.7</td><td>224.4</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC þ NPK</td><td>12.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC þ NPK</td><td>13.4</td><td>13.2</td><td>224.6</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>SED a</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment differences</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AC-control b</td><td>3.5 ^0.9</td><td>4.1 ^1.4</td><td>22.29 ^0.35</td><td>22.47 ^0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC-Leucaena AC c</td><td>0.5 ^1.0</td><td>1.2 ^1.6</td><td>20.10 ^0.40</td><td>20.53 ^0.28</td></tr></table>] ). The difference is small compared to SOC buildup under fallow vegetation, reported to be 21 Mg C ha 21 in 10 years of bush regrowth on a slightly more humid site (1470 mm yr 21 ) in SW Nigeria (Aweto, 1981) . This suggests that, for this environment, keeping part of the land under permanent fallow and concentrating production on the rest of the land might be a more effective way than AC to store or maintain C stocks in the soil as a way to reduce CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. However, the extra SOC in the AC systems is important for the maintenance of soil fertility: After 10 years the ECEC of the 0 -5 cm top soil averaged 4.5 cmol c kg 21 in the AC systems compared to an average 3.3 cmol c kg 21 in the two control systems (Vanlauwe et al., 2004) . The ECEC of the mineral fraction in the topsoil (9% clay, mainly kaolinite) was 1.0 cmol c kg 21 soil only, which underscores the importance of SOM for building the cation exchange capacity in this soil. Trees are an interesting option for producing extra organic matter because they can capture additional light and moisture not available to the crop, provided competition with the crops is avoided by proper separation in space or time. Expressed as a percentage of the total tree biomass (excluding wood) produced in a year, the biomass pruned at maize planting (first pruning in a year) amounted to 37% of the annual Leucaena biomass and 57% of the annual Senna biomass. This fraction of the biomass was almost entirely produced outside the cropping season using residual soil moisture and the erratic rainfall at the beginning and the end of the dry season.\n\nA comparison of the SOC buildup in the Senna AC system with the Leucaena AC system furthermore indicated that residues with lower quality entailed a larger SOC buildup. Senna residues decompose more slowly than Leucaena in line with their wider lignin-to-N and (lignin þ polyphenol)-to-N ratios (Vanlauwe et al., 1997) , but this quality effect was not accounted for in the simulations. As less OM is produced in the Senna AC system (Table 1 ) compared to the Leucaena system, the model thus predicts a 1.9 Mg C ha 21 lower SOC buildup in the Senna system in 2002 (Table 5 [TABREF4: TABLE Simulated SOC stocks and d 13 C values in the 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass (,0-12 cm) in 1997 and 2002 for the three cropping systems at two fertilizer levels <table><tr><td>Cropping system</td><td>Mg C ha 21</td><td/><td>d 13 C‰</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>1997</td><td>2002</td><td>1997</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control 2 NPK</td><td>11.0</td><td>10.3</td><td>222.5</td><td>221.7</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control þ NPK</td><td>10.6</td><td>9.9</td><td>222.1</td><td>221.2</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC 2 NPK</td><td>15.9</td><td>15.2</td><td>224.6</td><td>224.7</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC þ NPK</td><td>16.0</td><td>15.4</td><td>224.7</td><td>224.9</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC 2 NPK</td><td>14.6</td><td>13.0</td><td>224.9</td><td>224.7</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC þ NPK</td><td>15.6</td><td>13.8</td><td>224.5</td><td>224.5</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment differences</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AC-control a</td><td>4.8</td><td>4.3</td><td>22.4</td><td>23.3</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC -Leucaena AC b</td><td>20.8</td><td>21.9</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.2</td></tr></table>] ).

The present study demonstrated that the 13 C natural abundance technique is also useful for complex systems involving rotation and intercropping of different C 3 and C 4 plant species. When comparing experimental errors relative to treatment contrasts, d 13 C values were more precise and thus offered a more stringent test to the model than carbon contents (Table 3 [TABREF2: TABLE Treatment means of observed SOC contents and d 13 C values for the 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass (,0-12 cm) in 1997 and 2002 for the three cropping systems at two fertilizer levels <table><tr><td>Cropping system</td><td>Mg C ha 21</td><td/><td>d 13 C ‰</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>1997</td><td>2002</td><td>1997</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control 2 NPK</td><td>8.9</td><td>7.3</td><td>222.3</td><td>222.6</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control þ NPK</td><td>8.5</td><td>8.0</td><td>222.4</td><td>221.4</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.3</td><td>10.7</td><td>224.4</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC þ NPK</td><td>12.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC þ NPK</td><td>13.4</td><td>13.2</td><td>224.6</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>SED a</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment differences</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AC-control b</td><td>3.5 ^0.9</td><td>4.1 ^1.4</td><td>22.29 ^0.35</td><td>22.47 ^0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC-Leucaena AC c</td><td>0.5 ^1.0</td><td>1.2 ^1.6</td><td>20.10 ^0.40</td><td>20.53 ^0.28</td></tr></table>] ). Moreover, the total carbon and d 13 C value had a different sensitivity to the buildup of C 4 -carbon, and thus offered complementary information. This is because the old carbon remaining at the end of the trial was mainly of C 3 -origin. Calculations with Eq. ( 2) show that small changes in the quantities of C 4 carbon retained in the soil had a clear effect on the d 13 C values, whereas its effect on total carbon contents was masked by experimental errors. This was especially the case in the no-tree control treatments where the buildup of new carbon is relatively small and an extra 1 Mg C ha 21 of C 4 -origin, not statistically detectable in the total SOC level, raises the d 13 C value by 0.9‰ after 11 years.\n\nThrough the work of Jenkinson and Ayanaba (1977) it is well known that SOC decomposition in the humid tropical Ibadan climate proceeds four times faster than under temperate conditions in Rothamsted, and this temperature effect is built into the ROTHC model. The fact that we nevertheless had to double the ROTHC rate constants to correctly reproduce the observed contrast in SOC contents and d 13 C values between the AC and control treatments means that turnover was very fast in this experiment, about eight times faster than in Rothamsted conditions.\n\nVarious factors could explain this seemingly fast decomposition. A first factor to consider is possible SOC loss by soil erosion, a process not accounted for by the ROTHC-26.3 model. In a 6-year trial with the same continuous maize/cowpea rotation on a nearby site with a similar coarse-sandy top soil and a slightly steeper slope (7%), Lal (1989) observed average soil losses of the order of 4.3 Mg ha 21 yr 21 for a plowed plot without trees, 0.1 Mg ha 21 yr 21 for a no-till plot without trees, and 0.57 Mg ha 21 yr 21 for a Leucaena AC system with 4 m wide alleys. Even the largest soil loss (4.3 Mg ha 21 yr 21 ) corresponds only to an apparent C decomposition rate of 0.007 yr 21 ( ¼ annual soil loss/soil mass in top 12 cm £ 2 £ 1.5, where 2 is the sediment enrichment factor and the factor 1.5 accounts for the fact that the %C in the top 5 cm is 50% higher than the C% in the 0 -12 cm soil). Given Lal's work, carbon losses through soil erosion must have been negligibly small compared to losses due to SOM decomposition.\n\nTermite activity is another process that might explain the seemingly fast decomposition. Termites accelerate OM decomposition by comminution, but could also bury litter fragments in nests below the sampling depth or outside the plots. In an experiment in the same environment, Vanlauwe et al. (1998) observed that 15 N-labeled Dactyladenia barteri residues disappeared quickly from the surface litter layerfaster than observed in litterbags that excluded termites from the litter-without being recovered in the surface soil. Termite activity was suggested as a possible explanation. Termite activity on crop and tree residues was also observed in the present experiment, and could explain why the buildup of SOC in the surface layer was lower than expected. Yet little is known about the quantity of OM that termites can remove from the surface layer.\n\nIt is also possible that the mineral fertilizer or the legume tree prunings and/or rhizodeposition from the tree roots accelerated the turnover of SOM, and in this way reduced the difference in SOC levels between AC and control treatments. Such priming effects are not considered in the ROTHC-26.3 model, as is the case for most SOM models (Kuzyakov et al., 2000) . So the model predicted that the 'old' SOC decomposed at the same rate in all treatments, and we thus validated the model with this inherent assumption by comparing simulated and predicted contrasts of SOC contents and 13 C abundances between treatments. When examining the effect of fertilizer on observed (Table 3 [TABREF2: TABLE Treatment means of observed SOC contents and d 13 C values for the 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass (,0-12 cm) in 1997 and 2002 for the three cropping systems at two fertilizer levels <table><tr><td>Cropping system</td><td>Mg C ha 21</td><td/><td>d 13 C ‰</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>1997</td><td>2002</td><td>1997</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control 2 NPK</td><td>8.9</td><td>7.3</td><td>222.3</td><td>222.6</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control þ NPK</td><td>8.5</td><td>8.0</td><td>222.4</td><td>221.4</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.3</td><td>10.7</td><td>224.4</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC þ NPK</td><td>12.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.3</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC 2 NPK</td><td>11.6</td><td>11.6</td><td>224.8</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC þ NPK</td><td>13.4</td><td>13.2</td><td>224.6</td><td>224.8</td></tr><tr><td>SED a</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment differences</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AC-control b</td><td>3.5 ^0.9</td><td>4.1 ^1.4</td><td>22.29 ^0.35</td><td>22.47 ^0.24</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC-Leucaena AC c</td><td>0.5 ^1.0</td><td>1.2 ^1.6</td><td>20.10 ^0.40</td><td>20.53 ^0.28</td></tr></table>] ) and simulated (Table 5 [TABREF4: TABLE Simulated SOC stocks and d 13 C values in the 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass (,0-12 cm) in 1997 and 2002 for the three cropping systems at two fertilizer levels <table><tr><td>Cropping system</td><td>Mg C ha 21</td><td/><td>d 13 C‰</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>1997</td><td>2002</td><td>1997</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control 2 NPK</td><td>11.0</td><td>10.3</td><td>222.5</td><td>221.7</td></tr><tr><td>No-tree control þ NPK</td><td>10.6</td><td>9.9</td><td>222.1</td><td>221.2</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC 2 NPK</td><td>15.9</td><td>15.2</td><td>224.6</td><td>224.7</td></tr><tr><td>Leucaena AC þ NPK</td><td>16.0</td><td>15.4</td><td>224.7</td><td>224.9</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC 2 NPK</td><td>14.6</td><td>13.0</td><td>224.9</td><td>224.7</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC þ NPK</td><td>15.6</td><td>13.8</td><td>224.5</td><td>224.5</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment differences</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AC-control a</td><td>4.8</td><td>4.3</td><td>22.4</td><td>23.3</td></tr><tr><td>Senna AC -Leucaena AC b</td><td>20.8</td><td>21.9</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.2</td></tr></table>] ) SOC contents, we found no indications that fertilizer increased SOM turnover. However, it cannot be excluded that the high-quality residues from the legume trees and/or rhizodeposition from the tree roots accelerated the turnover of the old C compared to the control plots. Some laboratory incubation studies with 13 C or 14 C labeled residues indicate that the addition of easily decomposable OM to soil might double or even triple the mineralization of the soil C (Broadbent, 1947; Vanlauwe et al., 1994; Liang et al., 1999) . In a field incubation study with soil sampled from the control plot in the Ibadan long-term experiment, it was indeed observed that several legume residue types increased the decomposition of the native SOC soil carbon (K. Oorts, PhD thesis 539, K.U. Leuven). Unfortunately, there is little information about the extent to which such C-priming occurs in the field in the longer term.\n\nAn underestimation of the rate of decomposition of the incoming plant litter during the experiment could possibly explain the differences between model and observations as well. The short-to-medium term (, 2 years) decomposition of incoming plant materials is strongly dependent on litter quality. That these legume tree prunings decompose relatively fast is expected from their high N content: 4.2 -5.3% for Leucaena and 2.7 -3.6% for Senna leaves (Vanlauwe et al., 1997) . The effect of litter quality is handled in the model by the choice of the magnitude of the DPM and RPM fractions in the plant material. We might have underestimated the decomposition rate of the tree prunings to some extent, but that does not explain all discrepancies between the model and the data, as was shown by the model run in which we increased the DPM:RPM ratio of the tree prunings from 0.82 to 2.33.\n\nAnother reason for the fast decomposition might be the low physical protection of SOM in this sandy topsoil (9% clay, predominantly kaolinite). The effect of physical protection by clay is accounted for in the model by making the partition between CO 2 evolved and (BIO þ HUM) formed during decomposition dependent on the inorganic cation exchange capacity (CEC min ) based on the relationship derived from observations over the first 10 days in Sørensen's (1975) laboratory experiment with labeled cellulose. Quantitative information on the effect of clay content and type (or CEC) on long-term SOC dynamics are, however, scarce and variable. Decomposition studies in the field with labeled residues demonstrated that retention after 8 years in southern Australia and after 10 years in England was between 5 and 40% higher in heavier textured soils than in lighter textured soils (Jenkinson, 1977; Ladd et al., 1985) . The part in the ROTHC model dealing with the later stages of decomposition has been parameterized exclusively on data from experiments in Rothamsted (Jenkinson et al., 1992) on sites having high-activity clays and fairly high clay contents. Therefore, underestimation of the textural control effect on SOM stabilization could explain why the model underestimates the SOC decomposition rate for this sandy topsoil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type. If the textural control mechanism is indeed so much weaker in this soil, it would mean that SOM buildup is most difficult in those soils where SOM is most needed in order to attain sufficient cation exchange capacity.\n\nThe data from a 16-year field experiment in SW-Nigeria and modeling of the SOC dynamics during the trial using the ROTC26.3 model led to the following findings:\n\n1. SOC levels declined in all treatments. The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where SOC levels dropped from the initial 15.4 to 7.3-8.0 Mg C ha 21 in 16 years (SOC content in 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass). In the two continuously cropped AC systems (Leucaena and Senna), the SOC levels dropped to levels between 10.7 and 13.2 Mg C ha 21 . 2. The addition of mineral fertilizer (NPK) had little effect on the quantities of plant residues returned to the soil (sum of weeds, crop residues, and tree prunings), and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of SOC decomposition. 3. The 13 C natural abundance technique yielded useful information to test SOM models in a complex cropping system, in which both C 3 and C 4 plants were intercropped/rotated, and contrasts in the d 13 C of the SOC resulted from the fact that the relative OM contribution of the C 3 and C 4 components differed between the treatments compared. 4. The fact that we had to double the decomposition rate constants of the ROTHC-26.3 model in order to reproduce the observed contrasts in SOC contents and 13 C abundance between the AC systems and the control without trees indicated that SOC decomposition in this experiment was very fast. Possible reasons for this are (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction in the sandy top soil, in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type, was lower than assumed by the model. Termite activity could also have contributed to the seemingly fast decomposition.\n\nPresent address: Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Institute of CIAT, P.O.

{"id": "matthews1992", "title": "The potential of alley cropping in improvement of cultivation systems in the high rainfall areas of Zambia I. Chitemene and Fundikila", "text": "Three trials investigating the potential of alley cropping to improve the traditional systems of cultivation, chitemene and fundikila, in the Northern Province of Zambia are described. Flemingia congesta, Tephrosia vogelii, and Sesbania sesban, were grown in association with finger millet, groundnut, cowpea, and maize in various traditional cropping sequences. The indigenous species Tephrosia vogelii and Sesbania sesban were not able to withstand repeated pruning and the long following dry season, and were replaced with Calliandra calothyrsus, and Cassia spectabilis.\n\nOver a four year period, there was no benefit by alley cropping with any of the tree species on crop yields, and yields in alley crop treatments even dropped significantly below the control treatments in the fourth year, casting doubt on the potential of alley cropping for sustainable production. There was also no consistent effect on soil chemical characteristics in any of the trials. It was suggested that this lack of beneficial response to alley cropping was due to low tree biomass production, low quality of prunings, and an inappropriate cropping sequence. There was no evidence that alley cropping contributed to enhanced nutrient recycling, despite substantial locaiised pools of soil nutrients, particularly in the chitemene, with which recycling could potentially occur.\n\nThe high rainfall areas of Zambia are defined as those with an annual rainfall greater than 1000 ram, and cover Northern, Luapula, Copperbelt, and parts of North-Western Provinces. The greater part of the region is covered by miombo woodland, dominated by two tree genera, Brachystegia and Julbernardia, forming a 15-20 m high, single-story, light but closed canopy over a forest floor consisting mainly of Hyparrhenia and Digitaria grass species. The soils are generally acidic and low in inherent fertility, providing little support for permanent agriculture; local cultivators have, therefore, evolved forms of shifting cultivation characterised by short cropping periods and long fallows, known as chitemene and fundikila.\n\nChitemene has been well described by several authors [eg. Peters, 1950; Trapnell, 1953; Stromgaard, 1989] . It is a form of 'slash-and-burn' cultivation, but unique in that the lopped area is much larger than the cropped area. There is some evidence that the system is indigenous to the Zaire-Zambezi watershed, and that it was brought from that area during migrations in the 17th century [Stromgaard, 1989] . Although there are variations described by Stromgaard [1989] , the basic (or 'large-circle') form of chitemene is as follows. Branches are lopped from trees within the selected area between July and September, laid out to dry, and before the beginning of the rains in November, are gathered into a heap in the centre of the cut area. In general, the area of the heap is around 0.4 ha [Trapnell, 1953] , while the size of the cut area depends on the quantity of woody biomass in that area; where the regeneration period is long (30 years), it may be around 4 ha, but for shorter fallow periods may be as high as 11 ha [Peters, 1950] . The heap is burnt just before the first rains, with finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) usually being the first crop sown in the ash plot. The subsequent cropping sequence varies, but typically is groundnut (Arachis hypogaea (L.)), millet, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris (L.)) [see Trapnell, 1953] . Often cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is planted as an intercrop with the millet in the first year and harvested gradually from the third year onwards. When the field is exhausted after 4-5 years, it is abandoned and traditionally left fallow for 20-30 years [Mansfield, 1973] , and another field opened. Mansfield et al. (1975) estimated that the chitemene system could support between 2 and 4 persons per knl 2 depending on the amount of suitable land available.\n\nNearly 90% of farmers in the high rainfall region practise chitemene.\n\nIn the north-eastern part of the region, where the population is higher and there are fewer trees, the Mambwe people have developed the fundikila or 'grass-mound' system of cultivation. Detailed descriptions of the fundikila process are given by Stromgaard [1988] . It has been suggested that the system is a culmination of the breakdown of the chitemene system as the area became deforested by an increasing population [Stromgaard, 1989] . Briefly, the process involves the formation towards the end of the rainy season of mounds of grass (predominantly Hyparrhenia filipendula and Pennisetum purpureum) covered by earth on a previously fallowed site. The grass rots within the mound during the dry season, and at the start of the next rains the mounds are levelled, and finger millet planted. This may be followed in the second season by a variety of crops including maize (Zea mays (L.)), beans, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), and groundnuts.\n\nMillet is usually planted again in the third year, followed by a legume. In some cases, the field may be mounded every second year, and the crop planted on the mounds. This combination of green-manuring and alternating cereal crops with legumes helps to slow exhaustion of soil fertility. There is some evidence that the system is sustainable [Stromgaard, 1990] , but in practice the cropping period is 3-5 years, and the fallow period is traditionally up to 20 years [Mansfield, 1973] . It has been estimated that the fundikila system is able to support 20-40 persons/kin 2 [Mansfield et al., 1975] , considerably more than the chitemene system.\n\nAn increase in population is causing mounting pressure on these traditional cultivation systems, particularly chitemene, resulting in longer cropping periods and shorter fallow periods. Because the soils are not given time to regenerate their fertility, there is a general decline in crop yields. This has had the effect of increasing the cleared area relative to the cropping area, a reduction in length of fallow periods required for regeneration (25 down to 12 yrs), and changes in the frequency of opening up new gardens (previously 1 yr, now 2 yrs) [Chidumayo, 1987] . The improvement of chitemene and fundikila has been neglected due to the concentration on the hybrid-maize/ fertiliser based economy (see Part II), but with the increasing cost of imported fertiliser forcing many farmers to return to these traditional systems, it is clear that there is an urgent need to improve their productivity and sustainability.\n\nFollowing diagnostic and design exercises in the region [Huxley et al., 1986; AFRENA, 1989; Mattsson, 1989] , alley cropping was recommended as a potential agroforestry intervention for both the chitemene and fundikila systems. It was hoped that the use of fast growing leguminous trees to supply nitrogen and organic matter, and to mobilise nutrients from deeper soil layers, would help to maintain soil fertility for longer in an extended cropping period, and to ensure faster regeneration of fertility in a shortened fallow period.\n\nThis paper describes three trials at Misamfu Regional Research Station, Kasama, investigating the potential of alley cropping to maintain or improve crop production in the chitemene and fundikila systems. A second paper in the series [Matthews et al., 1992] considers its impact in fertilised maize cultivation systems in the region.\n\nThe three trials (referred to as Dll, D21 and D22 respectively a) were located at Misamfu Regional Research Station, in Northern Province (10°10'S 31°12'E). Figure 1 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Fig. 1. Climatic variables recorded at Misamfu Regional Research Station 1979-1990.] summarises monthly means of the climatic variables recorded at the station from 1978 to 1989. The mean annual rainfall is 1360 mm, and the mean monthly temperature ranges from 18 °C to 23 °C. The rainy season starts in November and ends in April, followed by a cool dry season from May to July, and a hot dry season from August to October. 'Pan evaporation' (IEt) is around 5 mm d -1 in the rainy and cool dry seasons, rising to 8 nun d -1 in the hot dry season. The dominant soils, classified as Orthic Ferralsols (FAO classification), are derived from non- basic rocks, and are strongly leached. Soil pedological, physical and chemical characteristics have been described by Mansfield et al. [1975] .\n\nAll three trials were initiated in 1986 with the purpose of evaluating the potential of alley-cropping to lengthen the cropping period and decrease the fallow period in each cultivation system. D ll began as a traditional chitemene, and D21 and D22 as traditional fundikila. Further details of each trial are as follows.\n\nTrial Dll (Chitemene)\n\nThe trial was a Randomised Block Design with three replicates and five treatments. Treatments were as follows:\n\n1. 4 years cropping + 3 years fallow 2. 6 years cropping + 1 year fallow 3. 4 years cropping + 3 years fallow + Flemingia congesta 2 hedgerows 4. 6 years cropping + 1 year fallow + Flemingia congesta hedgerows 5. 4 years cropping + 3 years cover crop (Cajanus cajan)\n\nThe results presented in this paper are those of the first four years; treatments 1, 2 and 5 (no trees), and treatments 3 and 4 (trees) are therefore pooled. The effects of all five treatments will be reported in a subsequent paper.\n\nDuring the dry season of 1986, an area of undisturbed miombo woodland on a Mufulira clay loam soil series was selected, and the trees lopped and piled in a 15 m wide and 120 m long strip. Based on a 5 m X 5 m sample, the amount of dry matter collected was 17.3 t ha -1. The chitemene was burnt on October 22, 1986, resulting in 8.5 t ha -1 of ash, measured using metal trays placed under the wood. Nutrient analysis of the ash was not made. No inorganic fertilisers were applied to the trial at any time.\n\nFlemingia congesta was chosen as the hedgerow species due to its high biomass production recorded elsewhere [Budelman, 1988b] , and its success in alley cropping systems in Nigeria [Yamoah et al., 1986b] . Seeds were germinated in a sand seedbed in the nursery, and transplanted to plastic pots one month later. Seedlings were transplanted from the nursery into the trial on November 12, 1986, in double hedgerows 3.8 m apart. The spacing was 0.6 m between the two rows of a given double hedgerow with 0.25 m within a row, giving around 21,000 trees ha -1 in total. Plot size was 8 X 15 m. The seeds were not inoculated with rhizobia, but were found to form considerable numbers of nodules with local rhizobia in the soil.

The yields of finger millet in the first year of the chitemene (Fig. 2a ) were high (mean: 2.3 t ha -1) in comparison with the fundikila trials (Figs. 2b and 2c ; mean: 0.5-0.6 t ha-l). By the fourth year, however, millet yields had dropped to around 0.4 t ha -1 in the chitemene while fundikila millet yields had actually risen to about 0.7 t ha -1. Although the growth of groundnuts in the Flemingia treatments appeared more vigorous in the second year, there was no significant difference in final crop yields between the treatments with trees and those without in the first three years.

There was considerable encroachment by weeds into all treatments in the fourth year, a factor probably responsible for the low overall yields.\n\nFundikila A (D21). Yields of millet were low in the first year of this trial, but following the leguminous cowpea crop, increased to around 1 t ha -1 in the third year falling again to around 0.6 t ha -1 in the fourth year (Fig. 2b ). Again, there were no significant differences between 'no-tree' and 'tree' treatments for the first three years, but in the fourth year, yields were significantly lower in the treatments with trees.\n\nFundikila B (D22). As different crops were sown in all four years in this trial, it is difficult to compare yield trends over that period. However, following two leguminous crops in the second and third years, mean maize yields in the fourth year were relatively high at 3.5 t ha -1 (Fig. 2c ). There were no differences in the first two years between 'no trees' and pooled 'trees' treatments, but in the third year there was a tendency for groundnut yields to be lower in the latter (although not significantly). However, by the fourth year, maize yields were significantly lower in the treatment containing trees (P = 0.01). There was no effect on crop yields of adding 200 kg ha -1 SSP in the subplot treatments until the fourth year, when there was a highly significant increase in the maize yield in all three tree species and the control treatment (P < 0.01).\n\nChitemene (Dll). Figure 3 [FIGREF2: FIGURE 3 Fig. 3. Soil analysis data for chitemene trial Dll. (a) 0--20 cm (b) 20--40 cm. [] pre-burn sample, • post burn sample, [] 1990 no trees, [] 1990 trees. SeeTable 1 for sampling dates.] shows the changes in soil chemical characteristics over the period 1986-1990 for the chitemene trial. As a result of the burn, there was a considerable increase in the 0-20 cm layer in the levels of Ca, Mg, K, A1, ECEC, P and of the pH. Organic carbon also increased slightly.\n\nAfter four years of cropping, by 1990, there was a significant decline in the level of K and P, but the other nutrients remained at much the same level. Similar trends were evident in the 20-40 cm layer, although were not so marked. In both soil layers the treatment with trees showed a tendency to be slightly lower than those without trees in Ca, Mg, K, ECEC, organic C, P and pH, although these differences were not significant.\n\nFundikila A (D21). Changes in soil chemical characteristics for this trial are shown in Fig. 4 [FIGREF3: FIGURE 4 Fig. 4. Soil analysis data for fundikila A trial D21. (a) 0-20 cm (b) 20-40 cm. [] pre-mound sample, • 1990 no trees, [] 1990 trees. Units as in Fig. 3. Vertical bars represent LSD0.05.] . In the 0-20 cm layer, there was little or no change for most nutrients over the period 1986-1990, although for Ca, A1, ECEC, and organic C, there was a slight increase. The situation was similar for the 20-40 cm layer, except that organic C declined. There was a tendency for the plots with trees to have slightly higher levels of most nutrients in both layers Table 1 for sampling dates. Units are Ca, Mg, K, Na, A1, ECEC: me (100 g)-l; Organic C: % w/w, Available P: ppm; pH in pH units. Note that available P values use fight hand axis. Vertical bars represent LSD0.05.\n\nat the end of the four-year period than those without, although these differences were not significant.\n\nFundikila B (D22). There were no significant differences between any of the tree species for any of the soil characteristics, so results are pooled across the three species and compared with the 'no trees' treatment (Fig. 5 ). In the main plot treatments of this trial, there was little change in any of the soil chemical characteristics within either layer, with the exception of organic carbon which increased in both, and available P which decreased in the upper layer and increased considerably in the lower layer, suggesting migration. The level of Ca also increased in the 20-40 cm layer. There were no significant differences between 'no tree' and 'tree' treatments in the fourth year. In the subplot treatments receiving SSP, available P was significantly lower in the 0-20 cm layer, but significantly higher in the 20-40 cm layer, again suggesting some migration.\n\nLeaf nutrient concentrations for each species are shown in Table 3 . Nitrogen levels ranged from 3.7% in Tephrosia vogelii to 6.3% in Sesbania sesban. The mean values of P, K, Ca and Mg were 0.081%, 0.728%, 0.458% and 0.123% respectively. Based on the mean of the rankings for each nutrient, Sesbania sesban and Gliricidia sepium had the overall highest level of nutrients, and Flemingia congesta the lowest.\n\n1 i J ! i i i t i i i i ,,o I__. I v, i i ! ,~t\n\nUsing these figures and the prunings biomass data from Table 2 , the contribution of nutrients made to the soil by each species was calculated (Table 4 ). For comparison, rates of fertiliser application recommended by the Zambian Department of Agriculture for small scale farmers are also shown.\n\nBecause of its relatively higher biomass production, Flemingia congesta in trial Dll contributed around 65 kg ha -x y-1 of nitrogen, although the average across all the species was only 40 kg ha -1 y-a N. The mean contribution of P was small in comparison to the recommended rates, although the amount of K contributed was around 40% of that recommended for maize, groundnut, and cowpea, and 80% of that recommended for finger millet.\n\nThe results from all three trials show that in both chitemene and fundikila trials alley cropping had no effect, either beneficial or detrimental, on crop Table 4 . Dry matter and nutrient contributions (kg ha -1 y-l) from the prunings of the hedgerows averaged over the 4 year period. Recommended almuai applications [LIMA, 1991] are shown for comparison.

A number of other studies have reported similar results; Lal [1989b] found in alley cropping trials in Nigeria that whereas there was a general decline in maize and cowpea yields over a 6 year period, maize yields were lower in alley cropped treatments than in the control. Singh et al. [1986] reviewing results for a number of alley cropping trials in semi-arid areas of Southern India found that alley cropping decreased overall yields of various crops. Work on acid soils at Yurimaguas, Peru, also showed lower yields of maize, cowpeas and rice in alley cropping treatments compared to the control [Szott, 1987] . On the other hand, some successes have been recorded, mainly with the tree species Leucaena leucocephala [eg. O'Sullivan, 1985; Watson and Lagnihon, 1985; Kang et al., 1985] . Similarly, Yamoah et al. [1986b] reported significant increases in crop yield with Flemingia congesta in Nigeria. These are discussed in more detail in Part II of this series. It is noteworthy that in all of these studies and in the present work, the yields of leguminous crops such as cowpea and groundnut were depressed by alley cropping, suggesting these crops were fixing adequate quantities of nitrogen by themselves, and that the presence of the trees only represented unnecessary competition.\n\nIn the chitemene trial (D11), the levels of most soil nutrients were slightly lower in the 'tree' treatments than those without, suggesting that there may be competition between trees and crop. In trial D21 there was slight evidence that alley cropping may have enhanced nutrient levels, but in trial D22, there was no difference in nutrient levels between alley cropping treatments and the control. However, as none of these differences were significant, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions. Results from other studies are also not consistent. Szott [1987] observed that there was less P, K, and Ca + Mg in the surface soil of the alley cropping treatment than in the control treatments in the Yurimaguas trials, and concluded that one of the reasons for lower yields in the alley crops was due to root competition for nutrients. Lal [1989a[ in alley cropping trials in Nigeria found that while soil organic matter, total N, pH, and exchangeable bases declined and total acidity and A13+ increased significantly in all treatments, these trends were least marked in the Leuceana leucocephala alley crop. Both Yamoah et al. [1986c] and Kang and Wilson [1987] , however, found a significant improvement in soil chemical properties under alley cropping in Nigeria. Lal [1989b] points out that the 'nutrient recycling' attributed to alley cropping is unlikely if the subsoil is extremely low in nutrients and there is little to recycle. Various authors have stressed the need for addition of fertiliser to low fertility alley cropping systems leg. Sanchez and Benites, 1987; Yamoah and Burleigh, 1990] . However, although the soils in Northern Zambia are of low fertility, both the chitemene and fundikila systems result in considerable localised enrichment of soil fertility. For example, measurements by Stromgaard [1984] indicate that the chitemene burn was equivalent to the addition of 176 kg ha -1 N, 346 kg ha -1 P, 433 kg ha -1 K and 308 kg ha -1 Ca to the soil. In the present work there was a substantial increase in the level of most soil nutrients after burning (Fig. 3 [FIGREF2: FIGURE 3 Fig. 3. Soil analysis data for chitemene trial Dll. (a) 0--20 cm (b) 20--40 cm. [] pre-burn sample, • post burn sample, [] 1990 no trees, [] 1990 trees. SeeTable 1 for sampling dates.] ). Similarly in fundikila, Stromgaard [1990] found that after one year, the mounds had significantly higher content of available cations than the surrounding flat-cultivated area, and after four years of a legume/cereal rotation on mounds alternating with flat cultivation, more nutrients had accumulated in the mound than were present before in the fallow. There are therefore considerable quantities of nutrients for alley crop trees to potentially recycle, particularly the highly mobile K which is leached back to pre-burn levels in the chitemene after one year [Stromgaard, 1984] . Losses of both P and K were evident in the present work, and were even slightly larger in the treatments with trees than those without (Fig. 3 [FIGREF2: FIGURE 3 Fig. 3. Soil analysis data for chitemene trial Dll. (a) 0--20 cm (b) 20--40 cm. [] pre-burn sample, • post burn sample, [] 1990 no trees, [] 1990 trees. SeeTable 1 for sampling dates.] ). In both fundikila trials, there was no difference in levels of P and K between the control and the alley crop treatments; there was also no statistical interaction between tree treatments and the addition of P fertiliser in trial D22. These seems to be little evidence, therefore, that nutrient recycling of any significance was occurring.\n\nFor alley cropping to be successful, the quantity, quality, and timing of prunings application are important [Swift, 1984[. In the studies where alley cropping has been shown to benefit crop yields, tree biomass production has been in the order of 6-8 t ha -1 y-1 using Leucaena leucocephala [Kang et al., 1985] . For Flerningia congesta, Budelman [1988b] recorded an annual dry matter production of 12.4 t ha y-~ in the Ivory Coast, while Yamoah et al. [1986b] measured 16.9 t DM ha -1 for Flemingia congesta in Nigeria. In the present work, however, although Flemingia congesta produced a maximum of 3 t ha -~ y-a in trial Dll, the mean annual production of all the species was only 1.3 t ha -1 y-i. Tree biomass production in Northern Zambia, therefore, appears to be considerably lower than elsewhere, a factor which may have been partly responsible for the lack of effect on crop yields.\n\nIn relation to the quality of prunings, Budelman [1988a] found slower decay, lower leaf nutrient content and a high C/N ratio of 21 in the prunings of Flerningia congesta compared to Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. As a C/N ratio of less than 10 is generally regarded as necessary to prevent the immobilisation of N by the incorporation of organic matter into the soil [Budelman, 1988a] , addition of Flemingia prunings may actually reduce rather than increase the level of N available to the crop. Flerningia also had the lowest overall level of nutrients (Table 3 ). Thus, the low quality of Flemingia prunings may have also been responsible for the lack of effect on crop yields. In the work of Yamoah et al. [1986b] , there was no difference in alley cropped maize yields whether Flemingia prunings were added or not.\n\nBiomass quantity and quality together determine the contribution of nutrients made to the soil by the prunings. However, the net benefit to the system must take into account the fact that most of these nutrients have come from the system itself. The average amount of nitrogen added through the prunings was 40 kg ha -1 y--1 N (Table 4 ). If it is assumed that about 35% of this was fixed biologically [Sanginga et al., 1989] , then this represents about 14 kg ha -1 y-1 N being added to the system, only 13% and 35% of the recommended N addition for maize and finger millet respectively [LIMA, 1991] . A significant proportion of K was added by the prunings, but P, Ca and Mg were present in the prunings in such low levels that their contribution to crop requirements was small. A proportion of each nutrient may have been brought from lower layers the crop could not reach, but further work is required to determine the importance of this source. However, the observations of Kessler and Breman ]1991 ] that many trees have very low fine-root densities below the crop rooting zone would suggest that the contribution from lower layers is small. Thus, the only benefit of alley cropping we can be reasonably sure of is the fixation of a relatively small amount of nitrogen, even less of which will be available to the crop due to losses from volatilisation, leaching, and manufacture of microbial protein. It would appear that the effective contribution of alley cropping to meeting crop nutrient requirements is comparatively small. Synchronisation of nutrient release with plant growth demands is also important. With most crops, the greatest nutrient demands are in the first five weeks of growth [see Yamoah et al., 1986a] , and demand lessens after this. The first pruning of the trees in the present work was at the onset of the rains after a long dry season in which there has been little growth, and there is a high wood and low leaf content. Decomposition is therefore slow, and the crop probably does not receive all the released nutrients when it needs them. In the second and third prunings, when there is substantial growth of readily decomposable leaf tissue, crop demands have lessened. Loss of these nutrients through leaching by the heavy rainfall at this time is highly likely. A potential improvement in the timing of pruning may be to shift the first pruning to the end of the previous season near the harvest. A variation of the fundikila technique could be employed in which tree prunings are incorporated in mounds or ridges at the end of the rainy season, allowed to decompose over the dry season, and levelled at the beginning of the next rainy season in preparation for the crop. In this way, high quality tree biomass is incorporated into the soil in the previous season, and as leaching losses are minimal over the dry season, would be available when crop demand is highest.\n\nIt may also have been that the traditional sequence of crops is not optimal for an alley cropping system. In the first year, the trees are still too small to have any benefit to the millet crop, although, of course, fertility is relatively high from the burn in the chitemene or the levelled mounds in the fundikila.\n\nIn the second year, as fertility begins to decline, cowpeas or groundnuts are grown, their own nitrogen fixation neutralising any potential benefit the prunings may offer. In the third year, alley cropping might be expected to benefit the maize or millet crop. In the fourth and fifth years when beans are normally grown, even if the trees are well estabfished they are unlikely to have any effect on yields of another legume. Thus, in a five year cropping period, there is only one year in which alley cropping might be expected to have any effect on crop yields. Farmers may be unwilling to invest capital and labour in planting and maintaining trees for such a small return. Of course, if alley cropping had shown some potential in maintaining soil fertility, it may have been possible to include extra cereal crops in the sequence.\n\nThus, it appears from these results that the potential of alley cropping to improve the yields or the sustainability of the traditional cultivation systems in the Northern Province of Zambia is limited, at least with the tree species being used at present. In all trials, after four years of alley cropping, there was a significant decline in crop yields compared to the control. It was felt that this was probably due to the low biomass production of the trees, poor litter quality, particularly of Flemingia congesta, and possibly unsynchronised nutrient release. It is suggested that future research should address these problems by focusing on the screening of new tree species for greater biomass production under the prevailing conditions, and on exploring ways of improving alley cropping management techniques.\n\n[FIGREF4: FIGURE 1 ~.~.~ ~:~]"}
{"id": "mattsson2014", "title": "Quantification of carbon stock and tree diversity of homegardens in a dry zone area of Moneragala District, Sri Lanka †", "text": "Homegarden agroforestry systems are suggested to hold a large potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is due to their multifunctional role in providing income, food and ecosystem services while decreasing pressure on natural forests and hence saving and storing carbon. In this paper, above-ground biomass carbon and tree species diversity of trees was quantified in homegardens around two villages in the dry south-eastern part of Moneragala district of Sri Lanka. A total of 45 dry zone homegardens were sampled on size, diameter at breast height, tree height and species diversity. Using allometric equations, we find a mean above-ground biomass stock of 13 Mega grams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha -1 ) with a large range among homegardens (1 to 56 Mg C ha -1 , n=45) due to a variation of tree diversity and composition between individual homegardens. Mean above-ground carbon stock per unit area was higher in small homegardens (0.2 ha, 26 Mg C ha -1 , n=11) and statistically different compared to medium (0.4-0.8 ha, 9 Mg C ha -1 , n=27) and large (1.0-1.2 ha, 8 Mg C ha -1 , n=7) homegardens. In total, 4,278 trees were sampled and 70 tree species identified and recorded. The Shannon Wiener index were used to evaluate diversity per homegarden and ranged from 0.76 to 3.01 with a mean value of 2.05  0.07 indicating a medium evenly distributed diversity of sampled tree species. The results show a vast heterogeneity in terms of carbon stock and tree diversity within the less studied dry zone homegardens; results that contribute to more knowledge of their expansion potential as well as climate mitigation and adaptation potential. The results are also useful for whether homegardens should be considered to be included as an activity to enhance natural forest cover within Sri Lanka's newly commenced UN-REDD National Programme.\n\nHomegardens are agroforestry systems common throughout the tropics (Nair and Kumar 2006; Mohri et al. 2013) . Homegardens are prime examples of multi-functional landscapes: spaces that combine agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems and are in Sri Lanka defined as a complex sustainable land-use system that combines multiple farming components, such as annual and perennial crops, livestock and occasionally fish, of the homestead and provides environmental services, household needs, and employment and income generation opportunities to the households (Weerahewa et al. 2012) . Others, such as, Kumar and Nair (2004) and Nair and Kumar (2006) provide a similar definition and suggest that a homegarden includes the concept of intimate plant associations of various trees and crops, sometimes in association with domestic animals, and consequent multi-story canopy configuration around the homestead. Despite the lack of a uniform definition of homegardens they are second to shifting cultivation the oldest land-use systems worldwide that have evolved through centuries of biological and cultural transformation (Nair and Kumar 2006; Pushpakumara et al. 2012) . In recent years, there has been growing interest in agroforestry systems due to their large potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation and their role to mitigate household food security and nutrition from soaring food prices (Minang et al. 2012; Nair 2012; Galhena et al. 2013) .\n\nHomegardens also store higher amounts of carbon than other agriculture systems in the above-and below-ground biomass and soils, but usually inferior to mature forests at the same site (Schroth et al. 2011; Mattsson et al. 2013) . The provisioning role of agroforestry and homegardens to maintain species diversity may also facilitate more stable and longer term stability of carbon stocks as well as diversification of homegarden derived products (Yachi and Loreau 1999; Brookfield et al. 2002; Henry et al. 2009 ).\n\nTo meet future challenges of land and water scarcity, and to ensure food security as a result to adverse effects of climate change, future mitigation and adaptation strategies that can be used by local land users through effective support by stakeholders and policymakers needs further attention (Murthy et al. 2013) . To identify such strategies, it is relevant to analyze quantitative information and estimates of tropical homegardens' ability to sequester and store carbon. Although, the importance and recognition of homegardens for carbon storage has been highlighted earlier (e.g., Kumar 2006; Nair 2012) there is still a lack of quantitative data on homegardens and their carbon content, especially in dry zone environments in Sri Lanka. Few studies have also related species diversity to ecosystem processes (Pushpakumara et al. 2012) . Since subsistence agriculture is predominantly practiced in the dry zone, the little research focus on dry zone homegardens warrants further investigation on this subject. Therefore, this paper focuses on assessing the amount and pattern of tree diversity and above-ground biomass (AGB) in homegardens around two selected villages in the southern part of Moneragala district in Sri Lanka. The objective is to investigate how the AGB carbon and tree diversity varies depending on parameters such as homegarden size, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height.\n\nBased on the mean annual rainfall, Sri Lanka is divided into three climatic zones. They are dry, intermediate, and wet mean annual rainfall of less than 1,750, between 1,750 to 2,500 and over 2,500 mm, respectively (see Fig. 1 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Fig.1 The study area and its location in the dry zone of the most southern part of Moneragala district as highlighted in red on the left image and green as sampling locations of homegardens on the right image. Note: 1, 2 and 3 of the left image represent the dry, intermediate and wet zones. Source: Modified from Google Earth, V 7.1.1.1888. 24 February (2013).] ) (MFE 1995) . In Sri Lanka, homegardens cover about 14% of the total land area (FAO 2009) . They are mainly privately owned and are managed through family labor using technologies that rely on rich local knowledge systems (Pushpakumara et al. 2010) . Sri Lankan homegardens provide staple foods, many kinds of fruits, vegetables, spices, fuelwood, fodder, timber, medicinal plants and occasionally livestock products throughout the year. Although being ancient land-use systems, governmental policies have recently encouraged establishment and expansion of homegardens in urban and sub-urban settings as a mechanism to reduce living costs and imports of food products, to enhance food security and maintenance of environmentally friendly-traditional agriculture methods. Examples include the most recent program \"Divi Neguma\" (Livelihood Development) that aim to establish 2.5 million homegardens to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables and to reduce vegetable prices by providing free seeds, fertilizer and technical advice (Kumari et al. 2009; Government of Sri Lanka 2011) . So far homegarden research in Sri Lanka has predominantly included various assessments of Kandyan homegardens located in the mid-country wet zone (Pushpakumara et al. 2010) .\n\nFew comparative analyses exists both in terms of tree diversity and AGB carbon stocks for dry zone environments in Sri Lanka. However, Mattsson et al (2013) estimated the carbon stock for dry zone Sri Lankan homegardens (Hambantota and Anuradnapura district) is ranging from 10 to 55 Mega grams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha -1 ) (mean 35 Mg C ha -1 ). For comparison, Kandyan homegardens in the wet zone had carbon stocks ranging between 48 to 145 Mg C ha -1 with a mean value of 87 Mg C ha -1 (ibid.) Homegarden diversity is by large controlled by ecological and socio-economic factors such as altitude, homegarden size, age of gardens, and personal preferences by the gardeners, market access and production intensity (Karyono 1990; Abdoellah et al. 2006; Nair and Kumar 2006; Peyre et al. 2006; Torquebiau and Penot 2006; Wiersum 2006; Pandey et al. 2007; Kehlenbeck and Maas 2008) . Ariyadasa (2002) estimated more than 400 different woody species in Sri Lankan homegardens. In 20 districts a total of 153,493 million trees have been recorded of which wet, intermediate and dry zone homegardens consists of 49, 37, and 14% of trees, respectively. The average density of trees in homegardens of Sri Lanka is varying from 20 to 475 trees ha -1 . The wet zone homegardens are considerably smaller in extent than dry zone homegardens but the total number of trees recorded within the wet zone is much higher due to the higher tree density (average of 260 trees ha -1 ) than those in the dry zone (average 125 trees ha -1 ). Higher species density has also been found in small homegardens than large homegardens (McConnell and Dharmapala 1973; McConnell 2003; Pushpakumara et al. 2012) .\n\nThe study was conducted in the neighboring villages of Padikapuhela (6°21'30' N-6°22'30'N and 81°14'30' E-81°15'10' E) and Pilimihela (6°21'00' N-6°21'60' N and 81°15'20' E-81°15'60' E), located in Thanamalwila Division in the most southern part of Moneragala district in the south-eastern part of Sri Lanka (Fig. 1 [FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Fig.1 The study area and its location in the dry zone of the most southern part of Moneragala district as highlighted in red on the left image and green as sampling locations of homegardens on the right image. Note: 1, 2 and 3 of the left image represent the dry, intermediate and wet zones. Source: Modified from Google Earth, V 7.1.1.1888. 24 February (2013).] ). The topography is undulating lying between 50-70 meters above sea level. Together with three small villages of same size, Padikapuhela and Pilimihela belong administratively to Beralihela which had a population of 1,793 in 2001. The villages are located within the driest agroecological zone (DL1) in the country where the soils are predominately alfisols (Panagos et al. 2011 ). The mean annual temperature is 27 °C and the mean annual rainfall is 1,050 mm (Department of Census and Statistics 2010). Most rain falls during the north-east monsoon (Maha season) from October to January while the south-west monsoon (Yala season) lasts from May to August and bring less rain (Seo et al. 2005) . Subsistence agriculture from paddy rice, banana, homegardens and shifting cultivation is the main income sources for the villagers (Withanage, pers. comm.). The village was established during the Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project (KOISP) in 1979 -1986 (Nijman 1992) ) where the government established new irrigated land within the Kirindi Oya River drainage basin to increase of food production, employment and providing arable land (IIMI 1995) . Hence, natural water flows are scarce in the area but diversion of irrigated water from Lunugamvehera reservoir provides water sufficiently for crop cultivation of paddy and banana during both monsoonal seasons. The area is also located close to the Lunugamvehera National Park, and thus the area is prone to wildlife interaction with negative effects on yields. Recently, intensive infrastructure development including an international airport and road developments has taken place close to the study area through state and foreign aided funds with increased prices of property as a result. A tank renovation project has also lately been established in the village through a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grants community based adaptation project and is expected to increase the water table and provide enough water for agricultural practices in homegardens and shifting cultivation lands for the villagers in the dry seasons.\n\nThe selected villages of Padikapuhela and Pilimihela were chosen, partly because the villages were included in a larger study in a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grants community based adaptation project \"Developing community-led strategies and infrastructure to ensure adaptation to drought conditions\". The objective of the programme was to ensure sustainable agricultural practices for rainfed farming families through village tank development, training programmes, marketing mechanism for agricultural products and introduction of alternate livelihoods (AUSAid 2012).\n\nForty-five homegardens were randomly sampled in March 2013. To cover the AGB carbon variation and species diversity of the individual homegardens in the village, the total area of all homegardens were sampled which resulted in a total sample area of 30 hectares. The homegardens were randomly selected in order to capture a representative mixture of size of homegardens, diversity and composition of tree species, as well as socio-economic status of householders although an analysis of the latter is not assessed in this paper. All sampled homegardens were between 20-30 years old and the size of homegardens ranged from 0.2-1.2 ha where a majority of homegardens were rectangular in shape.\n\nData on SOC collected from the same homegardens in March 2013 (n=40; Granberg et al. submitted) was used for data analysis to explore the correlation of SOC and AGB carbon. Data collected were subjected to analysis with SPSS version 21 using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis (OLS).\n\nAll perennial trees and plants with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ≥ 3 cm were measured. The DBH and tree height were measured using a DBH tape and a clinometer, respectively. Species information was collected for each tree in each homegarden. For comparison reasons, the homegardens were categorized into three size groups, namely small (0.2 ha), medium (0.4-0.8 ha) and large homegardens (1.0-1.2 ha). Given the lack of a standard approach and available allometric equations to estimate AGB for homegarden agroforestry systems in Sri Lanka, pan-tropical allometric equations developed for tropical natural forests were used. The allometric equation developed by Chave et al (2005) for dry zone forests (rainfall under 1,500 mm yr -1 ) was applied for individual trees using measured DBH and tree height as well as literature derived species-specific wood density of all sampled species (varying from 0.26-1.06 g cm 3 ) following Reyes et al (1992) and the Wood Density Database by Chave et al (2009) as input variables. In those cases wood densities were not found, a default value of 0.57 g cm -3 for the Asian region was used (Reyes et al. 1992) . For bananas and palms (primarily for Cocos nucifera) we used the equations developed by Arafin (2001) (cited in Hairiah et al. 2010) and Brown (1997) , respectively (Table 1 ).\n\nTable 1 Allometric equations used to estimate above-ground biomass for individual trees, bananas and palms in the dry zone homegardens Type of above-ground biomass Allometric equation R 2 Source Individual trees Y = exp (-2.187+ 0.916 × ln (D 2 ×H×S)) 0.99 Chave et al. 2005 Bananas Y = 0.030 D 2.13 0.99 Hairiah et al. 2010 Palms Y = exp (-2.134 + 2.530 x ln(D)} 0.97 Brown 1997\n\nY = above-ground biomass density (Mg ha -1 ), D = diameter in cm, H = height in m, S = species-specific wood density in g cm -3 .\n\nTree biomass was converted to carbon assuming that carbon accounted for 50% of the biomass (Brown 1997 ). The AGB carbon stock was calculated for each tree and was aggregated to calculate total AGB carbon stock for each homegarden. For comparisons on unit area basis the values were extrapolated to hectare size.\n\nTree species diversity was assessed within the fixed boundaries of the sampled homegardens acquiring common names that subsequently was translated into botanical names. An index was set up based on the number of species and their frequency in the homegardens. For this study we chose to use the Shannon Wiener index (SWI) due to its suitability for evaluating diversity in carbon sequestration projects (Ponce-Hernandez 2004). The Shannon-Weiner diversity characterizes the proportion of species abundance in the population, being at maximum when all species are equally abundant and the lowest when the sample contains one species. Shannon Diversity Index values usually range between 1.5 and 3.5 and seldom more than 4.5 (ibid). The proportion of species (i) relative to the total number of species ( ) was calculated and then multiplied by the natural logarithm of the same proportion (Ln\n\n). The resulting product is summed across species, and multiplied by -1 (equation 1).\n\nln( )\n\nThe above-ground biomass (AGB) carbon stock for the 45 sampled homegardens ranged from 1.0 to 56.7 Mg C ha -1 with a mean value of 12.7 Mg C ha -1 . Per unit area basis, mean AGB carbon stock was higher in small homegardens (0.2 ha, 26 Mg C ha -1 , n=11) and statistical different (p< 0.05) compared to medium (0.4-0.8 ha, 9 Mg C ha -1 , n=27) and large (1.0-1.2 ha, 8 Mg C ha -1 , n=7) homegardens (Fig. 2 ). By comparing the AGB carbon stock with number of tree species (Fig. 3 ) it is shown that that there is positive trend (not statistically significant) in relationship for small homegardens, a less positive relationship for medium size homegardens and a small negative relationship for large homegardens.\n\nFig. 2 Above ground biomass (AGB) carbon stock of small (0.2 ha), medium (0.4-0.8 ha) and large (1.0-1.2 ha) dry zone homegardens in Moneragala district of Sri Lanka. Error bars show standard error. Small homegardens are statistically different compared to medium and large sized homegardens whereas no significant differences are found between medium and large size homegardens.\n\nFig. 3 The relationship between above ground biomass (AGB) carbon stock per unit area and the diversity of trees of small (0.2 ha), medium (0.4-0.8 ha) and large (1.0-1.2 ha) dry zone homegardens in Moneragala district of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn total, 70 different tree and plant species were identified from 55 genera and 30 families and in total 4,278 trees were measured (see Online Resource 1). Fourteen species were unidentified. The most common species found was Neem (Azadirechta indica A. Juss., n=1014) accounting for 24% of all trees measured followed by Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L., n=509, 12%) and Coconut (Cocos nucifera L., n=362, 8%). Tree diversity described by the SWI showed a variation between 0.76-3.01 with a mean value of 2.05 0.07 where small sized homegardens had the highest mean diversity of trees, followed by medium and large homegardens (Table 2 [TABREF2: TABLE Tree diversity characteristics in different categories of homegardens of southern dry zone areas of Moneragala district in Sri Lanka. <table><tr><td/><td>Species</td><td/><td>Shannon Wiener index</td><td>Mean number</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan=\"2\">recorded per</td><td>(SWI)</td><td>of species ha -1</td></tr><tr><td>Homegarden size</td><td colspan=\"2\">homegarden</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Total</td><td colspan=\"2\">Mean Mean  SE Range</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Small (0.2 ha)</td><td>43</td><td>14.91</td><td>2.08  0.15 0.76 -</td><td>80  10.03</td></tr><tr><td>n=11</td><td/><td/><td>2.66</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Medium (0.2-0.8 ha)</td><td>58</td><td>15.52</td><td>2.07  0.09 1.08 -</td><td>23  2.13</td></tr><tr><td>n=27</td><td/><td/><td>3.01</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Large (1.0-1.2 ha)</td><td>37</td><td>15.57</td><td>1.94  0.16 1.52 -</td><td>15  1.78</td></tr><tr><td>n=7</td><td/><td/><td>2.60</td><td/></tr><tr><td>All categories</td><td>73</td><td>15.38</td><td>2.05  0.07 0.76 -</td><td>36  4.65</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td>3.01</td><td/></tr><tr><td>SE  standard error</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></table>] ). Mean number of tree species ha -1 were 80, 23 and 15, respectively for small, medium and large sized homegardens. Species area curve for the selected villages showed that covering of 90% of tree species require roughly 15 ha of cumulative land area or 50% of sampled area. The maximum diversity of an individual garden was recorded in a medium size garden and the minimum diversity was found in a small homegarden (Table 2 [TABREF2: TABLE Tree diversity characteristics in different categories of homegardens of southern dry zone areas of Moneragala district in Sri Lanka. <table><tr><td/><td>Species</td><td/><td>Shannon Wiener index</td><td>Mean number</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan=\"2\">recorded per</td><td>(SWI)</td><td>of species ha -1</td></tr><tr><td>Homegarden size</td><td colspan=\"2\">homegarden</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Total</td><td colspan=\"2\">Mean Mean  SE Range</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Small (0.2 ha)</td><td>43</td><td>14.91</td><td>2.08  0.15 0.76 -</td><td>80  10.03</td></tr><tr><td>n=11</td><td/><td/><td>2.66</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Medium (0.2-0.8 ha)</td><td>58</td><td>15.52</td><td>2.07  0.09 1.08 -</td><td>23  2.13</td></tr><tr><td>n=27</td><td/><td/><td>3.01</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Large (1.0-1.2 ha)</td><td>37</td><td>15.57</td><td>1.94  0.16 1.52 -</td><td>15  1.78</td></tr><tr><td>n=7</td><td/><td/><td>2.60</td><td/></tr><tr><td>All categories</td><td>73</td><td>15.38</td><td>2.05  0.07 0.76 -</td><td>36  4.65</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td>3.01</td><td/></tr><tr><td>SE  standard error</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></table>] ). As the size of homegardens increased, species richness on total homegarden area basis showed a very small increase. However, species richness ha -1 was much greater in small sized homegardens and secondly, medium sized homegardens than the large homegardens (Fig. 4 [FIGREF1: FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Tree species richness and tree species richness per hectare (ha) in relation to homegarden size for each sampled homegardens. Each homegarden is represented by a blue and a red symbol (2x40 homegardens = 80 symbols). Linear and exponential regression lines with equations and rsquared values are shown for species richness and for species richness per ha, respectively.] ).\n\nNo statistical significant difference was found between size-groups in terms of total species using twotailed exact Mann-Whitney U test even though the trend showed that the small and medium sized groups were more homogenous while the large size group showed a greater difference.\n\nA correlation analysis (a non-parametric Spearman test) was conducted by using soil organic carbon (SOC) measures from 40 of the same homegardens in a companion study (Granberg et al. submitted) where carbon content at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depth were assessed. No significant correlation between the SOC components and the terrestrial carbon components was found in our assessment (i.e., AGB, trees ha -1 , species ha -1 , size of homegardens, DBH or tree height). Hence, the SOC data was removed for further analyses. The remaining terrestrial carbon component did show significant correlation in several cases (Table 3 [TABREF3: TABLE Non-parametric correlation (Spearman's Rho) n=45 <table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Spearman's Rho AGB</td><td colspan=\"3\">Trees ha -1 Species ha -1 Size</td><td>DBH</td></tr><tr><td>Trees ha -1</td><td>0.748**</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Species ha -1</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.718** 0.814**</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td colspan=\"3\">-0.57** -0.601** -0.741**</td><td/></tr><tr><td>DBH</td><td>0.224</td><td>-0.302*</td><td>-0.209</td><td>0.253</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.436** 0.271</td><td>0.346</td><td colspan=\"2\">-0.221 0.211</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">** correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed);</td><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">* correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed)</td><td/></tr></table>] ). Since some of the parameters are directly correlated, such as size and trees or species ha -1 , it is worth noting that AGB correlate positively and significantly with trees and species ha -1 and height, while DBH shows no correlation. Further, the significant negative correlation between AGB and homegarden size suggests that the larger the homegarden the less carbon does the homegarden contain per unit area.\n\nFirstly, the large variability of AGB carbon among homegardens are primarily a result of tree density which is highest in small homegardens (small: 80 trees ha -1 ), followed by medium (23 trees ha -1 ) and larger units (15 trees ha -1 ). This is consistent with earlier findings (e.g. Kumar 2011 , Pushpakumara et al. 2012 ) although tree density is lower than those dry zone homegardens assessed in the study by Ariyadasa (2002) . Secondly, differences in carbon stock is a result of differences in tree diversity, management practices, homegarden age, site characteristics and composition differences (Montagnini and Nair 2004; Henry et al. 2009) . For example, in the large homegardens investigated in this study, farmers often use shifting cultivation practices to prepare and burn certain plots within the gardens for cash crop cultivation in the wet season with less tree densities as a result. Excessive shading from trees is also thought to have a detrimental effect on cash crop yields according to the homegarden owners.\n\nAs stressed earlier, few comparative analyses exists both in terms of tree diversity and AGB carbon stocks for homegardens in dry zone environments in Sri Lanka. However, the mean AGB carbon (13 Mg C ha -1 ) is lower and the large range (1 to 56 Mg C ha -1 ) between individual homegardens is higher than values shown earlier from Mattsson et al (2013) . Dissanayake et al (2009) estimated the AGB carbon stock in homegardens in Kandy (90 Mg C ha -1 ) and Matale (104 Mg C ha -1 ) districts and Premakantha et al (submitted) reported that homegardens in Nuwara Eliya district contain 77 Mg C ha - 1 . All the latter estimates are located within the wet zone and intermediate zone, and as expected, these values are higher due to a higher level of plant diversity and a denser canopy structure than dry zone homegardens. Outside Sri Lanka, Kumar (2011) found that Kerala homegardens in India had AGB carbon stocks ranging from 16 to 36 Mg ha -1 . Estimates from Javanese and Sumatran homegardens (35 to 59 Mg C ha -1 ; Jensen 1993; Roshetko et al. 2002) as well as mature (>35-year old) agroforests (101 Mg C ha -1 ) are higher than our estimates, but similar to 9-year old Sumatran agroforests (14 Mg C ha -1 ; Roshetko et al. 2002) .\n\nFor tree diversity, the mean Shannon Wiener Index (SWI) of 2.05 is lower than the SWI found by APN (2012) in the homegardens of the Keeriyagaswewa village (SWI: 2.13; n=59) located in the Sri Lankan dry zone but higher than in Siwalakulama village (SWI: 1.77; n=30; intermediate zone) and Pethiyagoda village (SWI: 1.99; n=59, wet zone) (ibid.) and in the Meegahakiula area (SWI: 1.55 to 1.77; intermediate zone; Senanayake et al. 2009) . The estimated SWI is also higher than the mean SWI found in homegardens from two villages in West Bengal, India and six villages in Dhaka Division, Bangladesh (APN, 2012) , but lower than in Kerala homegardens in India (Saha et al. 2009) . Mean Shannon-Wiener diversity indices in tropical homegardens have been reported to vary broadly from 0.93 in rural Zambia (Drescher 1998) to almost 3.0 in West Java, Indonesia (Karyono 1990 ).\n\nThus, the Shannon index is in keeping with prior studies of homegardens studied in other regions of Sri Lanka, indicating a medium evenly distributed diversity. This study also only considers trees, and the overall SWI would have been higher if all plants were included. The negative relationship between tree species richness and large homegardens is in keeping with Kumar (2011) although e.g. Abdoellah et al (2006) and Mendez et al (2001) found low correlation whereas Abebe (2005) , Kabir and Webb (2009) and Bardhan et al (2012) , found a positive relationship. Our negative relationship between tree species richness and large homegardens is probably a result of specific needs and preferences by the owner along with socio-economic factors. For example, in larger homegardens there are often distinct spatial arrangements between trees and crops, where most trees are planted around the house and low tree density areas are found towards the borders where cash crops such as bananas or leguminous crops are grown for imminent needs and local markets, hence lower tree diversity and tree density. In small homegardens on the other hand, homegarden owners often adopt more intensive management and denser planting in multiple layers, thus, higher tree species richness.\n\nNo relationship was found between measured parameters and soil organic carbon (SOC) in homegardens measured concurrently (Granberg et al. submitted) in a companion study. This is not consistent with the findings of Saha et al (2009) who found that species richness could provide greater stability of the SOC. The positive relationship between the SWI index and AGB carbon stock for small-sized gardens in relation to the slightly negative relationship for large homegardens and AGB carbon suggests that small-sized homegardens hold higher carbon stock and species diversity, in line with Kumar (2011) and Pushpakumara et al (2012) . Therefore, expanding homegardens into degraded and low-productive lands (such as shifting cultivation lands) for increased ecosystem services and carbon stocks as suggested by Mattsson et al (2013) would thus be more beneficial through the provision of small homegarden units rather than larger units. Also, the traditional use of homegardens has been around homesteads inherently meaning close to where people live. For sustained and enhanced ecosystem services such as carbon storage through expansion, would require new management strategies, for example that homegarden systems integrate more commercial oriented example plantation of perennials through a combination of exotic and/or indigenous species.\n\nFor the study area per se, recent large-scale infrastructure developments and investments in the area could in coming years have an effect on land prices, leading to a higher population density and increased demand for arable land. The village tank development under the auspices of the GEF Small Grants community based adaptation project are upon finish expected to provide water for both cultivation seasons (Maha and Yala) in the villages. Along with an increasing population, more homegardens are likely to be established while water accessibility would allow farmers and homegarden owners to opt for more perennial plants of different varieties and species which overall can enhance the carbon density and tree diversity which could favor higher productivity and ultimately sustained or improved food security.\n\nThe results of this study show that the investigated homegardens have good capacity for carbon storage and sequestration capacity which provides useful information for the national process of whether homegardens should be considered to be included as an activity within Sri Lanka's commenced National Programme on REDD+. This implies that developed countries provide incentives and financial compensation to developing countries for climate change mitigation benefits from maintaining and enhancing forest biomass. Homegardens could in this context be considered to be included within an existing or new forest definition to lower greenhouse gas emissions directly (Minang et al. 2014) . Another option could be to further promote homegarden establishment by intensification or extensification on marginal lands and serve as important buffers for the remaining natural forests in areas that are experiencing pressure from increasing populations. Consequences at the household level for such programmes needs to be explored further to investigate possible tradeoffs between for example biodiversity, economic, nutritional and financial benefits. For best outcomes at the local level, schemes such as REDD+ could be linked to existing or emerging developing programs highlighting food security and market integration since associated finance coming out of emissions based implementation is unlikely to be of main concern for local farmers (Bernard et al. 2013) .\n\nOur results suggests that the investigated homegardens in the southern part of the dry zone of Moneragala district of Sri Lanka hold a wide range of carbon between 1 to 56 Mg ha -1 and a mean above-ground biomass stock of 13 Mg carbon ha -1 , which is lower than other reported carbon estimates for homegardens in different ecological zones. The carbon estimates found here are reflecting the differences in tree density, tree diversity and management practices between individual homegardens. Furthermore, no correlation is found between soil carbon parameters and AGB carbon or diversity of trees. Smaller homegardens hold a higher carbon content and tree diversity than medium and large homegardens. Hence, based on the result here the expansion potential into degraded lands or larger units is not straight forward if carbon stock and tree diversity should be kept."}

Agriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state with 69% of the main workers engaged in the agricultural activities and 75% of the total reporting area is available for cultivation. Hill farming systems are dominated by small-scale and subsistence agricultural groups as about 89% of the landholdings in HP are constituted by marginal and small farmers (GoHP 2021). In comparison to larger and more financially oriented farms, these farmers have distinct land management goals and limits. Planting trees on farms helps farmers to satisfy their multifarious needs, which leads to increase in tree cover and thereby reducing the burden on existing forests. Being influenced by physiography, the climate within state varies greatly with some areas being warmed significantly during summers, while, some being covered with snow during winters resulting in the state being classified in four agro-ecological zones. In recent years, changing climate, population increase and decreased land holdings has called for the development of land use systems that reconcile agricultural production with the provisioning of ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation. Agroforestry provides end-to-end link between sustainability and profitability along with greater opportunities for the sustained productivity to tackle such problems. However, the adoption of agroforestry technologies depends on the edapho-climatic, socioeconomic status and farmer needs, and management is influenced by physical, demographic and institutional factors (Bayard et al. 2007) . Studies report that low lying areas of HP are highly exposed to the changing climatic conditions (GoHP 2012). Chamba district of HP is categorized by mountainous landscape ranging from 2000 feet to 21000 feet and is least explored for its agroforestry resources. So, keeping in mind the extent of exposure to climate change and the role of agroforestry in addressing the climate change effects, the study was carried out with the objectives of identifying the prevalent agroforestry systems (AFS) and to assess their carbon stock potential.\n\nThe present experiment was conducted during 2019-2021 at Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and\n\nThe findings revealed that five AFS were prevalent in the study area, viz. agrisilviculture (AS), agrihorticulture (AH), agrisilvihorticulture (ASH), silvopastoral (SP) and pastoralsilviculture (PS). Depending upon the functional components AFS can take numerous forms which are generally the result of primary needs of the society, topography, climate, edaphic conditions, biotic factors as well as economic aspects. The tree density and proportionate area under tree component in different systems varied from 50 (pastoralsilviculture) to 157 (silvopastoral) per ha and 0.20 (agrihorticulture) to 0.65% (silvopastoral), respectively. Among the prevalent AFS in the study area, the specific agricultural components consisted of Zea mays (Makki), Triticum aestivum (Kanak), Hordeum vulgare (Jau), Oryza sativa (Dhaan), Avena sativa (Jauvi), Capsicum annuum (Shimla mirch), Solanum lycopersicum (Tamatar), Solanum tuberosum (Baingun), Allium sativum (Lahsun), Coriandrum sativum (Ben), Brassica juncea (Sarson), Trigonella foenumgraecum (Methi) and Capsicum frutiscens (Pipli). In the present era when we are facing the adverse climatic conditions agroforestry in the form of traditional systems is cushioning our agroecosystems implicitly. The systems prevalent in the farmer field were mostly traditional having the higher proportion of forest species fulfilling the needs of the fodder, i.e. Grewia optiva (Beul), Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena), Ficus palmata (Dagla), Bauhinia variegata (Kachnar), Morus serrata (Toot), Prunus cerasoides (Paaja), Celtis australis (Khirak), timber, i.e. Toona ciliata (Tooni), Bombax ceiba (Semal), Melia composita (Drek), Dalbergia sissoo (Shisham), Punica granatum (Dadu), Tectona grandis (Sagwan), Celtis australis and fuel, i.e. Albizia chinensis (Black siris/Olha), Celtis australis, Leucaena leucocephala, Ficus palmata, Morus serrata, Grewia optiva, Bauhinia variegata, Pyrus pashia (Kainth) and Pistacia integerrima (Kakarsingi). However, with the changing scenario horti-based systems are being preferred by the farmers owning to the economic benefits, perennial nature, less management which also results in positive ecological benefits side by side. In the study area, various horti-based systems comprised Mangifera indica, Citrus limon, Litchi chinensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Psidium guajava, Carica papaya and Pyrus communis. Although, farmers are not much bothered about the climatic hazards as they are by the returns from the investment, so, if farmers can be motivated to adopt suitable agroforestry technologies based on their economic profitability and dual goals of raising farmer economy and addressing climate change can be fulfilled simultaneously. Topographically being hilly terrain, the conservation of the soil against erosion as well as stabilization of the farm bunds becomes important. Natural grasses retained on the farm bunds as well as adoption of the pasture based systems locally known as ghasnis, on the land left fallow is also of utmost importance. Major grasses present in the pasture based systems were Chrysopogon montanus, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris Forestry, Nauni, Solan (32°11′30\" to 33°13′6\"N and 75°49 to 77°3′30\"E), Himachal Pradesh. Three village panchayats were selected and from each panchayat 15 farmers were selected randomly comprised 5 farmers each from marginal, small and medium category. The AFS being practised by the selected farmers were identified on the structural and functional basis (Nair 1985) and named on the basis of the prime importance of the functional components.\n\nFor the estimation of biomass in the AFS, sampling was done by laying out the standard plots of 50 cm × 50 cm for herbage, 1 m × 1 m for agricultural crops, 5 m × 5 m for shrubs and 30 m × 10 m for the trees. For the biomass estimation of the herbage, agricultural crops and shrubs, the destructive method of sampling was used. In case of agricultural crops and herbage, the vegetation found within the sample plot was uprooted and the aboveground and belowground portions were separated and oven dried at 70 o C till a constant weight was obtained. For the estimation of shrub biomass, the shrubs were uprooted and the branches were categorized into different size classes. Three branches from each size class were selected to assess the oven dried weight of the branches which on multiplying with the number of branches in each size class gave the total oven dried weight. For trees, non-destructive method of biomass estimation based on volume equations was used (FSI 1996) . The aboveground biomass (AGB) of the trees was estimated as: where BEF, Biomass expansion factor. Belowground biomass (BGB) of tree was calculated by multiplying its AGB with a standard factor of 0.26 (Cairns et al. 1997) . Biomass carbon stock was calculated by multiplying the biomass with the standard factor 0.5 (IPCC 2003) . For the estimation of soil carbon stock, five soil samples, one from the centre and four from the corners, were collected from the depth of 0-30 cm from the sample plot laid to form a composite sample. Soil samples were then shade dried, grinded to pass through 2 mm sieve and stored in cloth bags for further analysis. Soil organic carbon density was calculated by multiplying % organic carbon with bulk density and soil depth and expressed in Mg/ha.

Similarly, maximum total biomass carbon have been reported under silvopastoral (Singh et al. 2018) and gayana, Cymbopogon martini, Setaria spp, Saccharum spontanum, Panicum maximum, Desmostachya bipinnata, Pennisetum spp and Cynodon dactylon. The results of the study were in line with the findings of several workers (Gupta et al. 2017 , Tiwari et al. 2018 , Sharma et al. 2021 and Sharma et al. 2023 ) who reported agrisilviculture, agrisilvihorticulture, agrihortisilviculture, agrihorticulture, silvipastoral, pastoralsilviculture, agrisilvipastoral and pastoralsilvihorticulture as the prevalent systems in low hills of HP. Fulfilment of fodder requirements and fuel wood demand, poor soil conditions, prevention of soil erosion as well as availability of the diversified products were attributed as the main reasons for adopting these systems.\n\nBiomass production potential of AFS: The AGB was significantly influenced by the type of AFS (P<0.001) and the interaction of farmer category with AFS (P=0.043) (Table 1 [TABREF0: TABLE Biomass production (Mg/ha) in different AFS among farmer categories <table><tr><td>AFS</td><td/><td>AGB</td><td/><td>Mean</td><td/><td>BGB</td><td/><td>Mean</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan=\"3\">Farmer Category (FC)</td><td/><td colspan=\"3\">Farmer Category (FC)</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Marginal*</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium</td><td/><td>Marginal*</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium</td><td/></tr><tr><td>AS</td><td>32.43</td><td>26.40</td><td>33.45</td><td>30.76 b</td><td>8.11</td><td>6.21</td><td>8.28</td><td>7.53 b</td></tr><tr><td>AH*</td><td/><td>25.51</td><td>19.12</td><td>22.32 a</td><td/><td>6.30</td><td>4.48</td><td>5.39 a</td></tr><tr><td>ASH</td><td>37.48</td><td>34.39</td><td>36.22</td><td>36.03 c</td><td>9.39</td><td>8.66</td><td>9.09</td><td>9.04 c</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>34.89</td><td>41.89</td><td>38.42</td><td>38.40 c</td><td>9.01</td><td>10.84</td><td>9.78</td><td>9.88 c</td></tr><tr><td>PS</td><td>15.76</td><td>22.21</td><td>21.40</td><td>19.79 a</td><td>4.05</td><td>5.44</td><td>5.84</td><td>5.11 a</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>30.14</td><td>30.08</td><td>29.72</td><td/><td>7.64</td><td>7.49</td><td>7.49</td><td/></tr><tr><td>LSD 0.05</td><td colspan=\"3\">FC-NS, AFS-4.12, FC×AFS-7.14</td><td/><td colspan=\"3\">FC-NS, AFS-1.09, FC×AFS-1.88</td><td/></tr></table>] ). However, effect of farmer category on AGB production was found to be non-significant. Among different AFS, the AGB production ranged between 19.79-38.40 Mg/ ha, which is in line with the AGB reported (4.58-70.91 Mg/ha) in the study area by several workers. The AGB reported is higher than that reported by Tiwari et al. (2018) , while, lower compared to the AGB reported by Gupta et al. (2017) and Panwar et al. (2022) in low hill zone of HP. Among all the systems, the maximum (38.40 Mg/ha) AGB was obtained for silvopastoral which was at par with the agrisilvihorticulture (36.03 Mg/ha), while, minimum (19.79 Mg/ha) was obtained for pastoralsilviculture which was at par with agrihorticulture (22.32 Mg/ha). Maximum biomass under silvopastoral system may be ascribed to tree density contributing to more biomass production along with structural and compositional differences of the system as reported by Singh (2018) and Sharma et al. (2021) . For interaction, maximum (41.89 Mg/ha) AGB was obtained for silvopastoral system under small category, while, minimum (15.76 Mg/ha) for pastoralsilviculture under marginal category.

Further, it was also found that soil organic carbon density in pastoralsilviculture was also higher which otherwise have lower biomass organic carbon stock that may tabe due to intensive root cycling taking place in grassland ecosystem.\n\nTotal carbon stock potential was significantly affected by the AFS (P=0.000), while, the farmer category as well as interaction between both didn't affected the total carbon stock significantly (Table 3 [TABREF2: TABLE Total carbon stock (Mg/ha) and soil:plant carbon ratio in different AFS among farmer categories <table><tr><td>AFS</td><td colspan=\"2\">Total carbon stock</td><td/><td>Mean</td><td/><td>Soil:plant carbon</td><td/><td>Mean</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan=\"3\">Farmer Category (FC)</td><td/><td colspan=\"3\">Farmer Category (FC)</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Marginal*</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium</td><td/><td>Marginal*</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium</td><td/></tr><tr><td>AS</td><td>46.53</td><td>43.48</td><td>47.17</td><td>45.73 b</td><td>1.31</td><td>1.84</td><td>1.26</td><td>1.47 a</td></tr><tr><td>AH*</td><td/><td>38.42</td><td>36.23</td><td>37.33 a</td><td/><td>1.43</td><td>2.04</td><td>1.74 a</td></tr><tr><td>ASH</td><td>50.44</td><td>56.19</td><td>52.63</td><td>53.09 c</td><td>1.15</td><td>1.61</td><td>1.34</td><td>1.37 a</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>56.03</td><td>63.79</td><td>62.93</td><td>60.92 d</td><td>1.61</td><td>1.42</td><td>1.64</td><td>1.56 a</td></tr><tr><td>PS</td><td>38.51</td><td>48.23</td><td>45.51</td><td>44.09 b</td><td>2.92</td><td>2.49</td><td>2.36</td><td>2.59 b</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>47.88</td><td>50.02</td><td>48.89</td><td/><td>1.75</td><td>1.76</td><td>1.73</td><td/></tr><tr><td>LSD 0.05</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></table>] ). Silvopastoral system was found to have highest total carbon stock potential which may be due to the dominance of the tree component along with the tree density in the system. Panwar et al. (2022) and Sharma et al. (2023) also reported higher carbon stock under silvopastoral system attributed to tree density as well as management practices. However, important point to note here is that under pasture dominated system the carbon stock stored in soil was more as compared to vegetation carbon stock as can be seen from the higher soil:plant carbon ratio of 2.59 under pastoralsilviculture system. Higher soil organic carbon may also be due to the dominance of broadleaved tree species having deep anchored root system (Kumar et al.\n\nagrisilvihorticulture (Singh 2018 ) systems attributed to the structural differences, management, edaphic conditions, growth of the vegetation etc. For interaction, maximum (26.37 Mg/ha) biomass carbon was obtained for silvopastoral system under small farmer category, while, minimum (9.90 Mg/ha) for pastoralsilviculture under marginal category farmers.\n\nSoil carbon density was found to have significant (P=0.000) influence of the AFS (Table 2 [TABREF1: TABLE Biomass carbon stock (Mg/ha) and soil carbon density (Mg/ha) in different AFS among farmer categories Mean values in respective row and column followed by different alphabet are statistically different at P<0.05, NS, Non-significant. *: Based on modified population marginal mean. <table><tr><td>AFS</td><td colspan=\"3\">Biomass carbon stock</td><td>Mean</td><td colspan=\"2\">Soil carbon density</td><td/><td>Mean</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan=\"3\">Farmer Category (FC)</td><td/><td colspan=\"3\">Farmer Category (FC)</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Marginal*</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium</td><td/><td>Marginal*</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium</td><td/></tr><tr><td>AS</td><td>20.27</td><td>16.31</td><td>20.86</td><td>19.15 b</td><td>26.25</td><td>27.18</td><td>26.31</td><td>26.58 ab</td></tr><tr><td>AH*</td><td/><td>15.91</td><td>11.80</td><td>13.85 a</td><td/><td>22.51</td><td>24.43</td><td>23.47 a</td></tr><tr><td>ASH</td><td>23.43</td><td>21.52</td><td>22.65</td><td>22.54 c</td><td>27.00</td><td>34.67</td><td>29.97</td><td>30.55 bc</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>21.95</td><td>26.37</td><td>24.10</td><td>24.14 c</td><td>34.08</td><td>37.42</td><td>38.83</td><td>36.78 d</td></tr><tr><td>PS</td><td>9.90</td><td>13.82</td><td>13.62</td><td>12.45 a</td><td>28.61</td><td>34.41</td><td>31.90</td><td>31.64 c</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>18.89</td><td>18.79</td><td>18.60</td><td/><td>28.99</td><td>31.24</td><td>30.29</td><td/></tr><tr><td>LSD 0.05</td><td colspan=\"3\">FC-NS, AFS-2.50, FC×AFS-4.33</td><td/><td colspan=\"3\">FC-NS, AFS-4.52, FC×AFS-NS</td><td/></tr></table>] ). Highest soil carbon density (36.78 Mg/ha) was recorded under silvopastoral system, while, minimum under agrihorticulture which was at par with the soil carbon density under agrisilviculture. Higher soil organic carbon in silvopastoral system may be due to the litter addition as well as decayed root material in the soil as compared to the other systems. Soil organic carbon is also influenced by litter quality, geographic location, land use and management. Systems which are relatively older and undisturbed have potential to store higher carbon (Panwar et al. 2022) which may be the cause behind the higher carbon accumulation in soil under silvopastoral system. Similarly, higher soil carbon pool was reported under silvopastoral (Goswami et al. 2014) in Himalayan region. However, the results were contrary to the findings of the Singh et al. (2015) CARBON STOCK POTENTIAL OF AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS 2021). Similarly, Goswami et al. (2014) also reported higher soil:plant carbon ratio in non-arable land uses, viz. silvipasture and pure grassland, highlighting the protective role of these systems on soil on one hand, while the vulnerability towards higher carbon emissions under degraded conditions on the other hand. However, Rajput et al. (2017) reported higher soil:plant carbon ratio under cultivated systems as compared to perennial tree based systems emphasizing the conservation needs of soil resources under these ecosystems.\n\nIn the study area, five AFS were prevalent, viz. agrisilviculture, agrihorticulture, agrisilvihorticulture, silvipastoral and pastoralsilviculture. Biomass production as well as carbon stock potential was not influenced significantly by the type of the farmer category, but, agroforestry system. Biological productivity of the agroforestry land use was found higher for the system dominated by perennial component with silvipastoral system being most productive among all the systems and having maximum carbon stock emphasizing the potential role towards climate change mitigation. Further, carbon stock potential of the agrisilvihorticulture shows that diversified composition can be beneficial from economical as well as ecological perspectives.\n\n[Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences 93 (6)\n\n[FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Stem biomass (Mg/ha) = VOB × WD where VOB, volume over bark (from volume equations); WD, wood density.

{"id": "singh2019", "title": "Biomass production and carbon stock potential of natural vegetation, agroforestry and cultivated land use systems along altitudinal gradient in north western Himalaya", "text": "The present study was undertaken in two altitudinal ranges 365-635 m and 636-914 m above mean sea level covering sub-montane, low hills and sub-tropical regions of Himachal Pradesh, India. The two altitudinal ranges were selected because of having common eight land use systems viz., agriculture (T 1 ), horticulture (T 2 ), agrisilvicultural (T 3 ), silvopastoral (T 4 ), agrihorticulture (T 5 ), agrihortisilvicultural (T 6 ), forest (T 7 ) and grassland (T 8 ). The experiment was carried out to identify variation in different land use systems in terms of biomass production and carbon stock potentials. The maximum value of aboveground biomass (184.75 t ha -1 ), belowground biomass (47.84 t ha -1 ) and total biomass (232.59 t ha -1 ) was recorded in forest land use system. All traits of biomass followed the order of T 6 >T 2 >T 5 >T 3 >T 4 >T 1 >T 8.. Among the agroforestry systems maximum aboveground (66.46 t ha -1 ), belowground (20.84 t ha -1 ) and total biomass (86.48 t ha -1 ) were accumulated in agrihortisilviculture system. The values of above, below and total biomass showed declining trend with increase in altitude. Vegetation carbon density also decreased with increasing altitudinal range. Among agroforestry systems, maximum (90.10 t ha -1 ) total carbon stock was observed in agrihortisilviculture, which was 2.45, 4.42, 10.67 and 44.80% higher than agrihorticulture, silvopastoral, agrisilviculture and agriculture land use system.\n\nThe role of forests (or trees) in carbon cycles is well recognized (Singh and Lal, 2000; Pala et al., 2012) and forests area is considered as large sink of carbon (Dixon et al., 1994; W ang et al., 2001) . There is considerable interest to increase the carbon storage capacity of terrestrial vegetation through land-use practices such as afforestation, reforestation, and natural regeneration of forests, grasslands, silvicultural and agroforestry systems (Brown, 1996; Ghosh and Mahanta, 2014; Chatuvedi et al., 2016) . Finding low-cost methods to sequester carbon is emerging as a major international policy goal in the context of increasing concerns about global climate change (Montagnini and Nair, 2004) . Agroforestry has been recognized to be of special importance as a carbon sequestration strategy because of its applicability in agricultural lands as well as in reforestation programs (Cairns and Meganck 1994; Ruark et al., 2003; Roy, 2016) . Conceptually trees are considered to be a terrestrial carbon sink (Houghton et al., 1998) . Therefore, managed forests can, theoretically, sequester carbon both in situ (biomass and soil) and ex-situ (products). By including trees in agricultural production systems, agroforestry can, arguably, increase the amount of carbon stored in lands devoted to agriculture, while still allowing for the growing of food crops (Kursten, 2000) .\n\nIn India, average sequestration potential in agroforestry has been estimated to be 25 t C per ha over 96 million ha (Sathaye and Ravindranath, 1998) but there is a considerable variation in different regions depending upon the biomass production. Several studies from forests of Indian Himalayan region (Shah et al., 2014; Pala et al., 2012; Iqbal et al., 2014) and agroforestry (Rajput et al., 2015; 2016) have been carried out in the recent past to explore the compatibility regarding carbon stock storage. In recent years, the farmers and field professionals of sub-montane and low hills, sub-tropical zone of Himachal Pradesh have developed various agroforestry systems integrating with timber, fodder, fruit trees and field crops and can store more carbon than monoculture land use. The main components of these land use systems are cereal crops, legumes, vegetable crops, fruit trees etc. The main forest tree species which dots the landscape of this agro-climatic zone are Poplar, Eucalyptus, Grewia, Morus, Toona, Siris and Bamboos etc. These agroforestry systems and other land use systems need to be tested for their carbon storage potential and environmental suitability in order to quantify the relative importance of these land use systems in today's contest. Therefore, the present study was undertaken in different land use systems of sub-montane and low hills, sub-tropical zone of Himachal Pradesh to estimate the biomass and carbon stocks in different land use systems.\n\nThe study was carried out (during 2015-2016) in agro-climatic zone of Himachal Pradesh, which was divided in two altitudinal ranges A 1 (365-635 m) and A 2 (636-914 m). The zone covers an area of 55,673 km 2 over six districts viz., Kangra, Hamirpur, Una, Bilaspur, Solan and Sirmaur. The area is located between 32º 50' to 30º 22' North latitude and 76º 18' to 77º 47' East longitude and 365 to 914 m above sea level altitudinal range (Fig 1 ). For the selection of sites, three districts were randomly selected for sampling. Each district was further stratified in two altitudinal range (365-635 m) and (636-914 m). At each altitudinal range three sites were selected randomly on the basis of altitude and from each site three villages were selected for further sampling. In both altitudinal ranges A 1 and A 2 eight different land use systems viz., agriculture, horticulture, agrisilvicultural, silvopastoral, agrihorticulture, agrihortisilviculture, forest and grassland denoted by T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 and T 8 were selected (Table 1 [TABREF1: TABLE Tree-crop combinations and their distribution under land use systems of sub-montane and low hills, sub-tropical zone of Himachal Pradesh <table><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>160, 520</td><td>230</td><td>450,180,70</td><td>130, 20, 20, 150, 70</td><td>160, 80,40</td><td>100, 110, 20</td><td>230</td><td>160</td><td>160,150,220,120</td><td>80, 100, 80</td><td>330</td><td>400, 150</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0.70</td><td>0.70</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.60</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.00</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>1.00</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.60</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.40</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>] ).\n\nThe climate of study area varied within different altitudinal ranges. This zone was affected by all three extreme climatic conditions, high temperature in summers (18-35º C), very low in winter (5-21º C) and heavy rainfall in rainy season. The average annual rainfall varied from 1400-1800 mm and most of which was concentrated during July-August, receiving about 80 percent of total annual rainfall. There was a vast variation in vegetation type in zone first. In forest ecosystem (land use) and tree based land use systems had huge variation in vegetation; grasslands had only herbs and shrubs. Important flora constituted in this zone was Acacia catechu, Grewia optiva, Pinus roxburghii, Shorea robusta, Toona ciliata, Dalergia sissoo in trees, common shrubs were Murraya koenigii, Pyrus pashia, Lantan camara, Artemisia vulgaris, Adhatoda vasica, Carrisa carandas and common herbs were Bidens pilosa, Xanthium strumar--ium, Cynodon dactylon, Cyperus rotundus, Chrysopogon montanus, Themeda anathera etc.\n\nAbove ground tree biomass: For measurement of above ground tree biomass in each land use system 0.1 ha plots (50 × 20 m 2 ) were laid down. The volume estimation of all the trees falling in the plot was enumerated. The diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured with calliper and height with Ravi's multimeter. Local volume equation developed for specific tree species and region were used for calculating the volume of the forest trees of the sample plot (FSI, 1996) . W here volume equation was not available for the concerned species, the general volume equations were used for volume (FSI, 1996) .The estimation of above ground biomass of woody trees was estimated by using expansion factors and specific gravity. The expansion factors for different species were available from previous literature (IPCC 2003; Rai et al., 2000) . Specific gravity was determined from the available literature (IPCC, 2003; Kaul and Sharma, 1983) . Wherever the specific gravity values were not available in that case the stem cores were taken to find out specific gravity which was used further to determine the biomass of the stem using maximum moisture method (Smith, 1954) .\n\nBelow ground biomass: Below ground biomass of trees was calculated by using the guidelines of IPCC (1996) and Cairns et al. (1997) . Below ground biomass of trees were calculated by multiplying above ground biomass with a factor of root: shoot ratio of particular tree (Rajput et al., 1985; Kumar, 1998) . Below ground biomass = above ground biomass × root: shoot ratio Fruit tree biomass: For estimation of fruit tree biomass, we developed diameter-dry biomass based equations. For this purpose, we visited orchard fields from time to time, when they were uprooting their orchards during winter. For each fruit tree crop we selected 20 trees. Each selected tree was then sectioned into secondary branches and main stem. The diameter of basal portion (with tree calliper) and fresh weight of each branch was determined in the field with the help of balance. After estimating the dry biomass of the each secondary branch, we developed non-linear regression equation between diameter and dry biomass of the branches. This regression equation was then used to estimate the dry weight of secondary branches of the sample trees of the sample plot.\n\nof the main stem log Cumulative weight of all the secondary branches = + Agriculture 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Horticulture 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Agrisilviculture 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Silvopastoral 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Agrihorticulture 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Agrihortisilviculture 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Forest 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl Grassland 365-635 m asl 636-914 m asl T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5 T 6 T 7 T 8 Maize-wheat, black gram-mustard Maize-wheat, paddy-wheat Mango, kinnow Mango Popular + toona + maize-barley, toona + sissoo + paddy-wheat Toon + morus + celtis + black gram-wheat, grewia + sissoo + maize -pea Eucalyptus, toona, morus+ natural grass Khair+sissoo+grewia+natural grass Kinnow + tomato-wheat, kinnow + maize-mustard Mango + maize -wheat, mango + tomato-mustard Maize-wheat + kinnow + toona + popular, paddy-wheat + mango + toona, black gram-onion + kinnow+toona Paddy-wheat + mango + eucalyptus, maize-galic + mango +toon Shorea robusta, Albizia lebbeck, A. procera, Terminelia arjuna, D. sissoo, Toona ciliata, Acacia catechu, Leucaena leucocephala.

The same trees were used for the estimation of the fruit tree root biomass and shoot-root ratio. Five plots of 1 x 1 m 2 were used for estimation of crop biomass. All the crop biomass occurring within the borders of the quadrates were cut at ground level and collected samples were weighed, subsampled and oven dried at 65 + 5 o C to a constant weight.\n\nThe crop biomass was converted into carbon by multiplying with a factor of 0.5 (IPCC default value). Below ground biomass of crops and grasses was calculated by multiplying above ground biomass of crops/grasses with a factor of root: shoot ratio of particular crop/grass.\n\nBelow ground biomass = above ground biomass × root: shoot ratio\n\nTo quantify standing floor mass, standing floor litter were randomly collected at five points using a 1m x 1m quadrates size. The standing floor litter inside the quadrate was collected and oven dried at 60 °C to a constant weighed. The litter biomass was converted to carbon by multiplying a default value of 0.370 (Smith and Heath, 2001) . Above and below ground carbon stock in vegetation was determined by vegetation biomass by multiplying with default value 0.5 (IPCC, 1996) .\n\nCarbon stock = biomass × 0.5 (IPCC default value)\n\nSoil samples were also collected, air dried in shade, grinded with wooden pestle, passed through 2 mm sieve, and stored in cloth bags for further laboratory analysis. Organic carbon content was estimated following Walkley and Black (1934) method. Soil mass for a particular soil depth was then computed from the bulk density and soil C stock was calculated for that soil depth by multiplying soil mass with soil organic C-content (Nelson and Sommers, 1996) .\n\nThe data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis as per the procedure suggested by Gomez and Gomez (1984) .\n\nAbove ground, below ground and total tree biomass production: Trees play an important role in soil C sequestration (Takimoto et al., 2009) ; with an increase in the number of trees (high tree density) in a system, the overall biomass production per unit area of land will be higher, which in turn might promote more C storage in soils. In the interaction effect between land use systems and altitudinal range, the above ground biomass declined with the increasing altitudinal range from A 1 to A 2 except in grassland in the present study. However, this decline was significant in agrisilviculture and silvopastoral systems only. Maximum (184.75 t ha -1 ) above ground biomass was found under forest land use system followed by agrihortisilviculture (66.46 t ha -1 ), horticulture (62.99 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (58.37 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (45.01 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (34.49 t ha -1 ), agriculture (17.09 t ha -1 ) and grassland (2.43 t ha -1 ), respectively. Agrihortisilviculture system had 3.88 times higher above ground biomass over agriculture system. Irrespective of land use systems, A 1 (63.33 t ha -1 ) had significantly higher biomass than A 2 (54.57 t ha -1 ) (Table 2 [TABREF2: TABLE Effect of land use systems, altitudinal gradient and their interaction on above ground, below ground, total and litter biomass production (t ha -1 <table><tr><td>)</td></tr></table>] ). Higher biomass production at lower altitude might be due to higher density of tree species in the systems, local climatic factors, higher fertility status because of their proximity to plains, management practices and differences in species composition (Rajput et al., 2015; 2016) .\n\nThe maximum below ground biomass was found in forest (47.84 t ha -1 ), which was significantly higher than other land use systems, and it was minimum in grassland (1.09 t ha -1 ). Among agroforestry systems, maximum below ground biomass production (20.02 t ha -1 ) was exhibited by agrihortisilviculture, and it was significantly higher than agrihorticulture (13.18 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (12.47 t ha -1 ) and silvopastoral (9.01t ha -1 ) systems (Table 2 [TABREF2: TABLE Effect of land use systems, altitudinal gradient and their interaction on above ground, below ground, total and litter biomass production (t ha -1 <table><tr><td>)</td></tr></table>] ). Agroforestry systems (AFS) produced 1.84 to 4.09 times higher below ground biomass than agriculture land use system. In fact, recent studies indicated higher soil C stock (amount of carbon stored in soil) under deeper soil profiles in AFS compared to treeless agricultural or pasture land systems under similar ecological settings (Haile et al., 2008; Nair et al., 2009) . In this connection, AFS are expected to have a great impact on the flux and long term storage of C in the terrestrial biosphere (Dixon, 1995) as the area of the world under AFS will hopefully increase substantially in the near future.\n\nThe maximum total biomass (232.59 t ha -1 ) was accumulated in forest land use followed by agrihortisilviculture (86.48 t ha -1 ), horticulture (74.25 t ha - 1 ), agrihorticulture (71.56 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (57.48 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (43.51 t ha -1 ), agriculture (21.98 t ha -1 ) and grassland (3.52 t ha -1 ) use systems (Table 2 [TABREF2: TABLE Effect of land use systems, altitudinal gradient and their interaction on above ground, below ground, total and litter biomass production (t ha -1 <table><tr><td>)</td></tr></table>] ). The total tree biomass production declined at all land use systems, except in grassland. The carbon sequestration potential of the vegetation component (above and belowground) also varied from 0.29 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in a fodder bank agroforestry system of West African Sahel to 15.21 Mg ha -1 yr -1 in mixed species stands of Puerto Rico (Nair et al., 2009) .\n\nLitter biomass production: Maximum litter biomass (1.87 t ha -1 ) was accumulated in forest, followed by horticulture (0.52 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (0.42 t ha -1 ), agrihortisilviculture (0.34 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (0.34 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (0.28 t ha -1 ) and grassland (0.14 t ha - 1 ), respectively. The minimum (0.06 t ha -1 ) litter biomass was recorded in agriculture system (Table 2 [TABREF2: TABLE Effect of land use systems, altitudinal gradient and their interaction on above ground, below ground, total and litter biomass production (t ha -1 <table><tr><td>)</td></tr></table>] ). The litter biomass declined significantly with increasing altitudinal range. Lower altitude (A 1 ) recorded 1.75 times higher litter biomass than higher altitude (A 2 ).The litter biomass production declined significantly with increase in altitude (from A 1 to A 2 altitude) in respect of land use systems viz., horticulture, agrisilviculture and forest.\n\nAbove ground, below ground and total biomass carbon stock: Forest land use system showed highest above ground biomass carbon stock (92.37 t ha -1 ). The above ground biomass carbon stock in horticulture (31.50 t ha -\n\n) was statistically at par with agrihortisilviculture (33.23 t ha -1 ) and agrihorticulture (29.19 t ha -1 ) land use system (Table 3 ). The minimum above ground biomass carbon stock (1.21 t ha -1 ) was observed in grassland system. Among the agroforestry systems, agrihortisilviculture recorded maximum (33.23 t ha -1 ) above ground carbon stock and it was 12.61%, 32.27 %, 48.09% and 74.3% more than agrihorticulture, agrisilviculture, silvopastoral and agriculture. Significantly higher above ground carbon stock (31.66 t ha -1 ) was found at lower (A 1 ) altitude than higher (A 2 ) (27.29 t ha -1 ). The role of forests (or trees) in carbon cycles is well recognized (Singh and Lal, 2000) and forests are considered a large sink of carbon (Dixon et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2010) . Now efforts are being made to increase the carbon storage capacity of terrestrial vegetation through land-use practices such as afforestation, reforestation, and natural regeneration of forests, silvicultural systems and agroforestry (Brown, 1996; Canadell and Raupach, 2008) .\n\nThe maximum below ground carbon stock was observed at A 1 T 7 treatment combination (28.38 t ha -1 ), which differed significantly with other combinations. It was observed that the below ground carbon had no significant difference in respect of land use systems at both the altitudinal ranges, except in silvopastoral and forest land use\n\nT 1 ( Agriculture) T 2 (Horticulture) T 3 (Agrisilviculture) T 4 (Silvopastoral) T 5 (Agrihorticulture) T 6 (Agrihortisilviculture) T 7 (\n\nForest) T 8 (Grassland) Mean T A T×A 10.98 32.42 26.65 22.52 30.29 35.45 94.03 0.96 31.66 SEm± 1.15 0.57 1.63 6.11 30.58 18.37 11.97 28.09 31.01 90.72 1.47 27.29 CD (P<0.05) 3.35 1.67 4.74 8.54 31.50 22.51 17.25 29.19 33.23 92.37 1.21 2.53 5.78 6.73 5.65 6.76 10.60 28.38 0.43 8.36 SEm± 0.27 0.13 0.38 2.36 5.48 5.74 3.36 6.42 9.41 19.46 0.66 6.61 CD (P<0.05) 0.79 0.40 1.13 2.44 5.63 6.23 4.51 6.59 10.01 23.92 0.54 13.51 38.20 33.38 28.17 37.05 46.06 122.41 1.39 40.02 SEm± 1.42 0.71 2.01 8.47 36.05 24.10 15.34 34.51 40.42 110.18 2.13 33.90 CD (P<0.05) 4.12 2.06 5.83 10.99 f 37.12 c 28.74 d 21.75 e 35.78 c 43.24 b 116.30 a 1.76 g Mean A 1 (365-635 m) A 2 (636-914 m) A 1 (365-635 m) A 1 (365-635 m) A 2 (636-914 m) A 2 (636-914 m) Mean Mean Land use system Above ground carbon stock Below ground carbon stock Total vegetation carbon stock Table 3 . Effect of land use systems, altitudinal gradient and their interaction on above ground, below ground and total vegetation carbon stock (t ha -1 ) systems. Maximum below ground carbon stock (23.92 t ha -1 ) was observed in forest system followed by agrihortisilviculture (10.01 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (6.59 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (6.23 t ha -1 ), horticulture (5.63 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (4.51 t ha -1 ) and agriculture (2.44 t ha -1 ), respectively (Table 3 ). Minimum value of below ground carbon stock (0.54 t ha -1 ) was recorded in grassland system. Below ground carbon stock showed decreasing trend with increase in altitudinal range.The results were in agreement with the findings of Rajput et al. (2015) , who reported that the biomass in forest ecosystem decreases with increasing altitude. Similar findings were also reported earlier by Minj (2008) , where all categories of biomass viz., aboveground, belowground and total biomass in different land use systems decreased with increase in altitude.\n\nMaximum mean total carbon stock (116.30 t ha -1 ) was observed in forest land use system followed by agrihortisilviculture (43.24 t ha -1 ), horticulture (37.12 t ha - 1 ), agrihorticulture (35.78 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (28.74 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (21.75 t ha -1 ) and agriculture system (10.99 t ha -1 ). Among agroforestry systems, agrihortisilviculture showed quite higher values of total biomass carbon stock than other systems and followed the trend of agrihortisilviculture > agrihorticulture > agrisilviculture > silvopastoral (Table 3 ). With respect to the effect of altitudinal gradient on total carbon stock, higher total carbon stock was also recorded in A 1 (44.00 t ha -1 ) than A 2 .\n\nLitter carbon density and soil carbon density: Litter carbon pool was found significantly higher under forest (0.69 t ha -1 ) followed by horticulture (0.19 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (0.15 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (0.13 t ha -1 ), agrihortisilviculture (0.12 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (0.10 t ha - 1 ), grassland (0.05 t ha -1 ) and agriculture (0.02 t ha -1 ), respectively. The litter carbon pool was found statistically at par in silvopastoral, horticulture and agrihortisilviculture. Irrespective of the land use systems, the litter carbon declined significantly with increasing altitudinal range. Maximum (80.44 t ha -1 ) soil carbon density was observed in forest land use system followed by silvopastoral (64.25 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (51.99 t ha - 1 ), grassland (39.48 t ha -1 ) and agriculture (38.72 t ha -1 ) (Table 3 4 ). The incorporation of trees or shrubs in agroforestry systems increased the amount of carbon sequestered when compared to a monoculture field of crop plants or pasture (Sharrow and Ismail, 2004; Kirby and Potvin, 2007) .The above results indicated that biomass components viz., above and belowground biomass and total biomass produced by particular land use system was influenced by the age of the components-annual or perennial, type of crop, structure of the system, nature and number of woody components, etc. Nayak (1996) observed that aboveground biomass was influenced by the plant species and their densities. Deshmukh (1998) reported that management practices also affected the biomass production of tree grown under different agroforestry systems.\n\nT 1 ( Agriculture) T 2 (Horticulture) T 3 (Agrisilviculture) T 4 (Silvopastoral) T 5 (Agrihorticulture) T 6 (Agrihortisilviculture) T 7 (Forest) T 8 (Grassland) SEm± CD (P<0.05) Altitudinal range (A) A 1 (365-635 m a.s.l.)

The land use systems of horticulture (96.38 t ha -1 ), agrihortisilviculture (90.10 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (87.89 t ha -1 ), Silvopastoral (86.11 t ha -1 ) and agrisilviculture (80.48 t ha -1 ) remained statistically at par with one another (Table 4 ). Trees are known for their high potential for converting radiant energy into organic matter as compared to the annuals. Forest ecosystems store carbon in large, long-lived species and in species with dense wood (Bunker et al., 2005) . Agrihortisilviculture land management systems had several species with diverse growth habits, root systems, mineral requirements enabling optimum use of available space and resources (Huxley, 1983) and lesser intensity of weed as compared to other systems (Toky et al., 1989) .\n\nThe variability in the productivity of agroforestry system as recorded in our study was in agreement with the observations of Albrecht and Kandji (2003) .\n\nTable 4 . Carbon pool (t ha -1 ) in different components of the system as influenced by average effect of land use system and altitudinal gradient altitudinal range. The lower altitude showed maximum vegetation carbon in all categories. It was approximately half of the vegetation biomass and also affected by the factors of the vegetation biomass. The higher values of these traits in this treatment combination might be ascribed to higher average age diameter of the tree component at this altitudinal range, nature of the functional component in question and intensity of management involved. Indeed, the average age of the timber trees was quiet higher than agricultural crop, fodder and fruit based land use systems. In addition to it, the biomass production and its removal was quiet high in field crops.\n\nDifferent land use systems had significant influence on production of above, below and total biomass. All traits of biomass followed the order of T 6 >T 2 >T 5 >T 3 >T 4 >T 1 >T 8. W hereas, among the agroforestry systems maximum aboveground (66.46 t ha -1 ), belowground (20.84 t ha -1 ) and total biomass (86.48 t ha -1 ) was accumulated by agrihortisilviculture system followed by agrihorticulture, agrisilviculture and silvopastoral system, respectively. Agriculture land use showed 74.28, 75.57 and 74.58% lower aboveground, belowground and total biomass than the agrihortisilviculture system, respectively. The values of above, below and total biomass showed declining trend with increasing altitude. The altitudinal range also had significant influence on vegetation carbon density.\n\nThe study, therefore, indicated that the forest land use system had higher (197.43 t ha -1 ) carbon stock (vegetation + litter + soil) among all land use systems, but agrihortisilviculture system had higher carbon stock (90.10 t ha -1 ) than agriculture and all other agroforestry systems. Hence, increase in tree cover seems to be a viable option for mitigation of carbon increase in atmosphere.\n\nMaximum vegetation carbon pool (116.29 t ha 1 ) was observed in forest land use and minimum (1.42 t ha -1 ) in grassland (Table 4 ). Carbon pool under agrihortisilviculture and horticulture systems was found to be statistically at par. Further it was observed that vegetation carbon declined with increasing altitudinal range. Biomass carbon (aboveground, belowground and total carbon) density was significantly influenced by"}
{"id": "tumwebaze2011", "title": "Soil organic carbon under a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Uganda", "text": "The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the amount and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) under a linear simultaneous agroforestry system with different tree species treatments. Field work was conducted at Kifu National Forestry Resources Research Institute in Mukono District, Central Uganda, in a linear agroforestry system established in 1995 with four different tree species and a crop only control treatment. Soil samples were collected in 2006 at three depths; 0-25, 25-50, and 50-100 cm, before planting and after harvesting a maize crop. The results indicate that an agroforestry system has significant potential to increase SOC as compared to the crop only control. There was no significant difference in the amount of SOC under exotic and indigenous tree species. Among the exotic species, Grevillea robusta had higher SOC than Casuarina equisetifolia across the entire depth sampled. There is significant difference in SOC among the indigenous species, where Maesopsis eminii has more SOC than Markhamia lutea. Distance from the tree row did not significantly influence SOC concentration under any of the tree species. In selecting a tree species to integrate with crops that will sequester reasonable quantities of carbon as well as boost the performance of the crops, a farmer can either plant an exotic species or an indigenous. In this study, the soil under Grevillea robusta and Maesopsis eminii have the highest potential to store organic carbon compared to soil under other tree species.\n\nAgroforestry systems are frequently considered to be carbon sinks because the integration of trees in agriculture results in greater CO 2 sequestration from the atmosphere (Albrecht and Kandji 2003) . Agroforestry systems have the potential to sequester between 21 and 240 Mg C ha -1 over one or two decades, depending on tree species and density (Dixon 1995; Montagnini and Nair 2004) . In the humid tropics, the potential of agroforestry (tree-based) systems to sequester C in vegetation has been estimated to range between 25 and 70 Mg C ha -1 in the top 20 cm of soil (Mutuo et al. 2005) . In degraded soils of the subhumid tropics, improved fallow agroforestry practices increased topsoil C stocks up to 1.6 Mg C ha -1 above that of continuous maize cropping (Mutuo et al. 2005) .\n\nThe efficiency of agroforestry systems to store C in tree biomass and soils depends on species used, management practices, environmental and socio-economic factors. For example, estimates have shown that the combination of woody perennials and annual crops has the potential to store between 29 and 53 Mg above-ground C ha -1 in the humid highlands of Africa, between 39 and 195 Mg C ha -1 in South America, and between 12 and 228 Mg C ha -1 in Southeast Asia (Winjum et al. 1992) .\n\nDespite studies showing the potential of agroforestry in sequestering C, estimates of amount of C sequestered under specific agroforestry systems are limited due in large part to variability of soil C and time and resource constraints associated with sampling (Albrecht and Kandji 2003; Koskela et al. 2000) . The purpose of this study is to quantify the amount and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in a linear simultaneous agroforestry practice. Our specific objectives are to (1) quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) within 100 cm of the surface, (2) assess impacts of exotic and indigenous tree species on SOC levels, and (3) determine whether SOC varies with distance and direction from the tree row.\n\nIn this study, examining influences of different tree species is important in order to assist landowner in selecting appropriate tree species when implementing agroforestry practices on lands previously employing non-agroforestry practices. Sampling SOC at different distances from tree crop is important to study in order to assist in determining an optimal inter-cropping spacing with respect to C sequestration. Difference between pre-planting and post-harvest C distribution provide information about the interaction effects of different tree species and maize on SOC when maize is used as a cash crop.\n\nThe study was conducted at Kifu National Forestry Resources Research Institute (NaFORRI) (latitude 0°48 0 N, longitude 32°46 0 E, elevation 1,250 m above sea level (asl)) in Mukono District, Central Uganda. Kifu is located approximately 30 km east of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. Rainfall is distributed bimodally, with long rains starting in March and ending in June while short rains start in August and end in November. Data from the metrological station at the site show that the annual rainfall was 1,266 mm in 1996 and 1,520 mm in 2001 (Okorio 2000; Wajja-Musukwe 2003) . Between 2002 and 2006 , the average annual rainfall was 1,560 mm. The annual minimum and maximum temperatures at Kifu are 20.8 and 25.2°C, respectively.\n\nThe vegetation is characterized by elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and remnants of high tropical forest and eucalyptus woodlots (Okorio 2000) . Swamps are covered by papyrus reeds (Cypresus papyrus) and sedges are found in several valley bottoms. Kifu is set in the crystalline basement characterized by metamorphosed granites and soils originating from quaternary alluvial and lacustrine deposits (Water Department 1996) . The FAO/UNE-SCO soil map classifies the soils as mainly Ferralsols, with Gleysols in the swamps and a small area of Intosols. The soils are slightly acidic sandy loams with bulk densities in the range of 1.5-1.7 Mg m -3 (Okorio 2000) .\n\nFour tree species were included in this study. Casuarina equisetifolia L. is an evergreen with a finely branched and open crown that attains heights of 6-35 m tall and dbh (diameter at 1.3 m above ground) up to 100 cm. The altitudinal range where this species grows naturally is from 0 to 1,400 m asl with a mean annual temperature of 10-35°C and mean annual rainfall of 200-3,500 mm. The species prefers deep well-drained coarse textured soils (MacDicken 1994) . It grows in association with actinorhizal bacteria, through which it fixes atmospheric nitrogen. The tree has proteoid roots and forms association with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae. Grevillea robusta A. Cunn. is a deciduous tree, which grows up to 12-25 m tall and 80 cm dbh. The crown is conical and fairly open with moderate competition to crops. The tree trunk is straight and branches up to 15 m. The species grows at an altitudinal range of 0-2,300 m asl, requires a mean annual rainfall of 600-1,700 mm, mean annual temperature of 14-31°C and prefers medium texture soils, but establishes well in alluvial soils. The species occurs naturally in Australia, and has been introduced into sub-tropical highland regions of the world and is widely planted in Africa (Harwood 1992) .\n\nMaesopsis eminii Engl. is a leafy semi-deciduous tree, which grows up to 10-30 m in height with a clear bole of up to 100 cm dbh. The umbrella-like dense crown competes with annual crops but is compatible with shade tolerant perennials. The species grows at an altitudinal range of 700-1,500 m, requires mean annual rainfall of 1,200-1,300 mm and mean annual temperature of 22-27°C. It grows best on deep moist fertile sandy loam soils but tolerates a wide range of site conditions. It occurs naturally in Uganda, East, Central and West Africa (Katende et al. 1995) . Because of its dense canopy, it has been used as a shade tree for coffee in Uganda, cocoa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cardamom plantations in southern India.\n\nMarkhamia lutea K. Schum. is an evergreen tree, growing to 15 m in height, with a narrow irregular crown and deep long tap root. Highly competitive to crops, this species is found within an altitudinal range of 900-2,000 m, requiring a mean annual rainfall of 800-2,000 mm and a mean annual temperature of 12-27°C. It grows best on red loam soils but can tolerate well-drained acidic clay loams. It occurs naturally in lake basins and highlands of East Africa with high rainfall including Uganda (Katende et al. 1995) . Markhamia lutea grows rapidly in forest soils and the tree can attain a height growth rate of 2 m per year. The tree can be pruned and pollarded to reduce shading and can be coppiced at 1.7 m in height.\n\nA completely randomized block design consisting of four blocks each containing six treatments was used.\n\nThe six treatments consisted of 5 tree species and control plots with no trees. The tree species were: (1) Alnus acuminate, (2) Casuarina equisetifolia, (3) Grevillea robusta, (4) Maesopsis eminii, and (5) Markhamia lutea. All treatments were replicated four times in 24 plots, of which the tree plots measured 25 9 30 m while the control plots were 15 9 30 m wide. Alnus acuminata was not included in the study because of its poor growth in all the blocks. A buffer of 5 m between plots was created to reduce the edge effect between species plots. The agroforestry system was selected according to the types of crop/species commonly preferred by the local community in Uganda.\n\nThe trial was established in 1995 as a linear simultaneous agroforestry system (Wajja-Musukwe et al. 2008) , where trees were planted in the field in September 1995 as 4-month seedlings from the nursery. The seedlings were planted in a row down the middle of the plot (25 m by 30 m) along an east-west axis at 1 m spacing, resulting in 24 trees per plot (Wajja-Musukwe 2003) . After 3 years of growth, the trees were thinned by removing every other tree and crown pruning was done to reduce shade by removing one-third of the crown before planting of the crops (Okorio 2000; Wajja-Musukwe 2003) . According to Wajja-Musukwe (2003) , the first root pruning was conducted in 1999, prior to sowing of crops to reduce below ground competition between crops and trees. Root pruning was repeated at 50 and 62 months after planting, the roots were pruned on one side of the tree row in each plot (Wajja-Musukwe et al. 2008) . During Wajja-Musukwe (2003)'s study, the plots were prepared by deep cultivation before onset of the rains, and weeded twice each season. Super phosphate (298 kg ha -1 ) and NPK (25, 5, 5; 149 kg ha -1 ) was applied before maize was sown. Details on average diameter breast height (dbh) and height of the trees at the time of this study can be obtained in (Tumwebaze 2008) . Much of this site had been under fallow since the last agroforestry experiments in 2000. The field site was visited on 5 June 2006 and it was learned that blocks three and four had been intercropped with maize for two seasons (1 year). Blocks one and two were still under fallow and had not been cropped since 2000.\n\nA 2.5 9 2.5 m grid was superimposed in each 25 9 30 m tree plot and 15 9 30 m control plot, from which 120 and 72 subplots were obtained, respectively. Each plot was stratified by direction (east and west direction) and distance from the tree row (i.e., 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 m). At each distance, one subplot was randomly selected resulting in six subplots on either side of the row of trees. A total of 240 subplots were investigated, resulting in a sampling intensity of (240/2,208) 9 100 = 10.9%. Soil samples were collected from three depths in each plot for a total of 720 samples each time the soils were sampled.\n\nSoil samples were collected using a soil auger (0.083 m diameter) at three depths; 0-25, 25-50, and 50-100 cm for both before planting and after harvesting maize crop. Three soil cores within each subplot were composited by depth. After collection and air drying, soil samples weighing 1.5 kg were transported to the Forest Soils Analytical Laboratory at SUNY ESF, Syracuse, NY for analysis. Samples were processed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and root fragments. After mixing, a subsample was withdrawn for analysis of soil organic matter by loss on ignition (LOI) (Bickelhaupt and White 1982) . Organic matter was converted to organic C concentration by using two conversion factors; 1.92 for top soil (0-50 cm) and 2.5 for subsoil (50-100 cm) (Nelson and Sommers 1996) . Twenty-five of the 720 samples were missing due to errors in labeling during sampling and transportation.\n\nTo determine soil bulk density, an undisturbed soil sample was removed from each subplot by the core sampler at each of the three depths (total of 240 9 3 depths = 720 samples). The samples were oven-dried at a temperature of 105°C until constant weight was attained. Bulk density was calculated using the dry mass divided by core volume (Oelbermann and Voroney 2007) .\n\nExploratory data analyses were used to describe and explore trends in the data (i.e., line graphs, bar graphs, and summary statistics). Due to the lack of independence in sample locations within and between fixed effects (through time and space), the data collected before planting (pre-planting) maize and after planting and harvesting maize (post-harvest) were analyzed with a linear mixed model using PROC MIXED in SAS (Littell et al. 1996) . Measurements from a single auger sample separated into various depth classes are expected to be correlated. In the experimental design this is considered as a repeated factor (repeated in space) and sampling at various distance perpendicular to the tree row is a repeated factor in space Schabenberger and Pierce (2002) hence the use of linear mixed model. The fixed effects were assessed at 5% significance level. Both horizontal and vertical variation of soil organic carbon were assessed using mixed models and by specifying an autoregressive covariance structure, since the data were equally spaced (Littell et al. 1996) .\n\nData for soil bulk density were analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed model procedure. Autoregressive covariance structure was fitted to the data using the linear mixed model\n\nEQUATION\n\nwhere, l is the overall mean, b i (i = 1-4) is the random effect of the ith block effect, q j (j = 1-5) is the fixed effect of the jth treatment (species plus control), a k (k = 1-2) is the fixed effect of the kth direction of sun rise (direction) and sun set, qa jk is the interaction between treatment and direction, c l (l = 1-6) is the fixed effect of lth distance from the row of trees (distance), qc jl , ac kl are interactions between treatment and distance, interaction between direction and distance, respectively, qac jkl is the interaction between treatment, direction and distance, s m (m = 1-3) is the depth at which all soil samples were obtained in the block i for jth treatment in kth direction and lth distance, sq jm , sa km , sc lm are interactions between depth and treatment, interaction between depth and direction of the sun and interaction between soil depth and distance from row of trees, qas jkm is the interaction between treatment, direction of the sun and depth, qcs jkl is the interaction between treatment, distance from the row of tree and soil depth, sqac jklm is the interaction between treatment, distance from tree row, direction of the sun and soil depth, e ij are the experimental errors assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with mean 0 and variance r 2 . e ijk are random variations within plots, taking into account the variation due to different directions and have mean 0 and variance r 2 þ r 2 d , e ijkl are random variations within plots, taking into account the variation due to different directions and distances has mean 0 and variance\n\nr 2 þ r 2 d þ r 2\n\np , e ijklm are random variations of soil samples taken at the different depths have mean 0 and variance\n\nr 2 þ r 2 d þ r 2 p þ r 2 t :\n\nBefore specifying the autoregressive covariance structure, and to account for the correlation due to repeated measurements in space (distance and depth), different covariance structures [compound symmetry (CS), 1st order autoregressive (AR(1)), and unstructured (UN)], were fitted to both the baseline (before planting) SOC and after harvesting the maize SOC data. Covariance structures were assessed using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).\n\nAlthough SOC concentrations across all depths and spatial locations were generally higher pre-planting (19.4 ± 4.0 g C kg -1 ) compared to maize postharvest (18.5 ± 3.8 g C kg -1 ), spatial variability was high. Soil bulk density ranged from 0.49 to 2.38 Mg m -3 , with a relatively high average (1.69 Mg m -3 ) over the study site. Bulk density varied significantly (P \\ 0.05) among treatments and increased with depth.\n\nVariation in SOC over distance from tree row and soil depth (pre-planting) SOC data were evaluated within and across the plots by depth and distance. The following factors were considered fixed effects: species, direction of sun, depth and distance, while block and all the factors that were combined with blocks are random effects. The results showed that AR(1) covariance structure had the smallest AIC and BIC values (Table 1 [TABREF0: TABLE Fit statistics for mixed model analysis of baseline (pre-planting and post-harvest) soil organic carbon using three different covariance structures to account for the correlation due to repeated measurements in space (distance): CS compound symmetry, AR(1) 1st order autoregressive, and UN unstructured <table><tr><td>Fit Statistics</td><td colspan=\"2\">Covariance structures</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Pre-planting data</td><td/><td/><td>Post-harvest data</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>CS</td><td>AR(1)</td><td>UN</td><td>CS</td><td>AR(1)</td><td>UN</td></tr><tr><td>-2 Res log likelihood</td><td>-4,420</td><td>-4,422</td><td>-4,425</td><td>-4,415</td><td>-4,416</td><td>-4,422</td></tr><tr><td>AIC</td><td>-4,412</td><td>-4,414</td><td>-4,409</td><td>-4,407</td><td>-4,408</td><td>-4,406</td></tr><tr><td>BIC</td><td>-4,415</td><td>-4,417</td><td>-4,413</td><td>-4,409</td><td>-4,411</td><td>-4,411</td></tr></table>] ).

Soil organic carbon decreases with increasing soil depth, where the highest SOC was registered at 0-25 cm and the least occurred at 50-100 cm for all the tree species and control treatments (Fig. 1a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Fig. 1 Soil organic carbon variation over soil depth (a) pre-planting and (b) post-harvesting maize in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda] ). Maesopsis eminii had the highest soil organic carbon at 0-25 cm while Grevillea has the highest soil organic carbon at both the 25-50 and 50-100 cm soil depths (Fig. 1a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Fig. 1 Soil organic carbon variation over soil depth (a) pre-planting and (b) post-harvesting maize in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda] ). The significant treatment effect showed that before planting the maize crop, SOC varied differently among the different tree species and control treatments. Grevillea robusta and Maesopsis eminii species had the highest soil organic carbon at all three soil depths, while control plot with no trees (control) had the least soil organic carbon at all soil depths (Fig. 1a [FIGREF0: FIGURE 1 Fig. 1 Soil organic carbon variation over soil depth (a) pre-planting and (b) post-harvesting maize in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda] ).\n\nThe significant interaction between direction and depth indicated that changes in SOC at increasing soil depth were different between the east and west side of the tree row (Fig. 2 ). There was greater SOC at soil depth of 0-25 and 50-100 cm on the western direction, while slightly higher amounts of SOC were obtained in the east direction at 25-50 cm compared to the west direction (Fig. 2 ). There was slightly more SOC between 2.5 and 7.5 m from the tree row on the eastern side whereas higher SOC was shown in the western direction from 7.5 to 12.5 cm (Fig. 3 ). Results indicated that SOC did not significantly change, on average, as distance increased from the tree row.

The soil organic carbon (Mg C ha -1 ) was calculated by multiplying the soil bulk density per depth and the SOC concentrations for both pre-and post planting. SOC stored under M. eminii before planting maize was 317.86 Mg C ha -1 and reduced to 300.58 Mg C ha -1 after planting and harvesting maize. The values of SOC for all the tree species was higher than control plots with no trees (Table 7 ).\n\nSoil organic carbon varied significantly among treatments and across all depth before planting maize crop but there was non significant difference in SOC between the treatments after planting and harvesting the maize crop. This may be due to loss of SOC through soil and root respiration which occurred after Fig. 2 Interaction plot for depth and direction before planting maize in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda clearing the site by slashing and tillage (Lal 2004 ). The impact of tree harvesting showed a significant reduction in SOC between before and after harvesting, which was attributed to harvesting disturbance (Oliver et al. 2004 ).\n\nThe trees in the experimental site were 11 years old, and after this period, the existing SOC in the control plots (with no trees) was significantly (P \\ 0.05) less than the plots with the trees (Table 2 [TABREF1: TABLE Modeling distribution of soil organic carbon (before planting) <table><tr><td>Effect</td><td>Num df</td><td>Den df</td><td colspan=\"2\">Treating horizontal distance</td><td colspan=\"2\">Treating vertical depth</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td colspan=\"2\">from row of trees as a repeated effect</td><td colspan=\"2\">as repeated effect</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td>F value</td><td>Pr [ F</td><td>F value</td><td>Pr [ F</td></tr><tr><td>Treat</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>5.53</td><td>0.009</td><td>5.6</td><td>0.009</td></tr><tr><td>Dir</td><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>2.28</td><td>0.152</td><td>2.1</td><td>0.168</td></tr><tr><td>Treat 9 Dir</td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>1.45</td><td>0.265</td><td>1.35</td><td>0.296</td></tr><tr><td>DistT</td><td>5</td><td>75</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.607</td><td>0.63</td><td>0.681</td></tr><tr><td>Treat 9 DistT</td><td>20</td><td>75</td><td>0.64</td><td>0.868</td><td>0.58</td><td>0.916</td></tr><tr><td>Depth</td><td>2</td><td>75</td><td>400.15</td><td>\\0.0001</td><td>430.39</td><td>\\0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>Treat 9 Depth</td><td>8</td><td>75</td><td>1.23</td><td>0.296</td><td>1.31</td><td>0.252</td></tr><tr><td>Dir 9 DistT</td><td>5</td><td>487</td><td>2.68</td><td>0.021</td><td>2.43</td><td>0.037</td></tr><tr><td>Dir 9 Depth</td><td>2</td><td>487</td><td>3.77</td><td>0.024</td><td>4.57</td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td>DistT 9 Depth</td><td>10</td><td>487</td><td>1.19</td><td>0.293</td><td>1.26</td><td>0.249</td></tr><tr><td>Treat 9 Dir 9 DistT</td><td>20</td><td>487</td><td>0.94</td><td>0.537</td><td>0.81</td><td>0.695</td></tr><tr><td>Dir 9 DistT 9 Depth</td><td>10</td><td>487</td><td>0.82</td><td>0.611</td><td>0.95</td><td>0.487</td></tr><tr><td>Treat 9 Dir 9 DistT 9 Depth</td><td>88</td><td>487</td><td>1.05</td><td>0.367</td><td>1.13</td><td>0.222</td></tr></table>] ). Similar results have been previously reported (Thevathasan Fig. 3 Variation in mean soil organic carbon before planting and after harvesting maize over different distances from tree row on the east and west side of the line of trees for a control (bare soil), b Casuarina, c Grevillea, d Maesopsis and e Markhamia, over all soil depths in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda Gordon 2004; Soto-Pinto et al. 2007) . A study on the tree intercropping systems in north temperate regions found that the C sequestration potential in hybrid-Liriodendron tulipifera intercropping system was four times higher than that of conventional agricultural fields in the region (Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) , while a comparison of corn fields to Taungya, tropical-improved fallow, sub-tropical improved fallow, coffee-tree system and traditional agroforestry systems concluded that agroforestry systems contained more SOC than the corn field (Soto-Pinto et al. 2007) . The higher SOC found in the agroforestry systems compared to maize crop or bareland may be attributed to incorporation of more litter fall from the trees (i.e., leaves, branches and twigs) into soil that adds organic matter and improves soil quality. Below-ground, tree roots penetrate to deeper soil layers than crop roots and bring nutrients to the surface via leaf fall (Schroeder 1993) . The success of the intercropping system depends mainly on the capacity of the system components to maximize resource utilization, while at same time maintaining complementary interactions among them (Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) . It has been noted that perennial woody plants may possess a greater potential to exploit the below-ground environment directly than seasonal plants because, over multiple years, the root systems of woody plants can grow incrementally or parts of the root systems can be replaced in situ from season to season, hence increasing nutrient capture (Huxley 1999) . In addition, multistrata agroforestry practices will contribute litter from a mixture of species, providing a better nutrient balance in the soil as compared to monocropping systems, hence increasing soil organic matter in form of litter and root matter (Ong et al. 1996) . Woody species in agroforestry are capable of having better spatial and temporal utilization of available growth resources than annual species.\n\nThe structural attributes of agroforestry, such as multiple vertical strata, allow the system to occupy space efficiently and provide a range of growing conditions (Schroeder 1993 ). The tree canopy in an agroforestry system provides shade and reduces evaporation from the soil. This shading effect also reduces temperature and provides a more moderate microclimate for crop growth. The tree canopy also provides shelter from wind, protects the soil from the impacts of heavy rain and helps to reduce soil erosion. Leaf litter acts as mulch and reduces evaporation, surface runoff and erosion, hence protecting the topsoil, which has more soil organic carbon and other soil nutrients. Therefore, agroforestry systems have a greater potential to increase soil organic carbon compared to the bareland or crop only practices. These characteristics may make agroforestry systems more resistant to climate change than monocropping systems.\n\nDistance from the tree row did not significantly influence SOC concentration for the treatments in this study, although it has been found that total soil C within the hybrid (Poplar) Liriodendron tulipifera intercropping site was significantly higher at 1 and 2 m away from the tree row compared to the middle of the alley (Thevathasan 1998) . The results of this study are similar to previously reported research (Oelbermann and Voroney 2007; Peichl et al. 2006; Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) , in which no significant differences in the amount of SOC were found at varying distances from the line of trees. Thevathasan and Gordon (2004) reported that SOC did not change significantly in the three distance zones from crop trees (0-2.5, 3-8, 8-15 m) 6 to 8 years after tree planting. Furthermore, it was observed that 15 years after planting, Liriodendron tulipifera trees were 14 m tall and leaf biomass was evenly distributed across the crop alley to a distance of up to 15 m, which resulted in a slow increase in SOC in the middle of the crop alley (Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) . Oelbermann and Voroney (2007) noted that after 13 years of alley cropping with hybrid Liriodendron tulipifera, the SOC and N pools did not differ significantly with distance from the tree row, although a trend of a large SOC and N pool near the tree row was observed. Peichl et al. (2006) indicated that the non-significant change in SOC as distance increases from the tree row was due to height of the Liriodendron tulipifera tree (i.e., 18 m), where the C input from litterfall is distributed evenly across the width of the crop alleys. This pattern is similar to the trees in the linear simultaneous agroforestry system in the current study, where all the trees were, on average, greater than 18 m in height, except for Markhamia lutea, which is 15 m. Hence no marked trend in SOC was observed with distance from the tree row.\n\nThere was no significant difference (P [ 0.05) in SOC between exotic species (Casuarina equisetifolia, and Grevillea robusta) and indigenous species (Maesopsis eminii and Markhamia lutea) (Table 6 [TABREF5: TABLE Mean change (pre-planting-post-harvest) in soil organic carbon in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda by soil depth and agroforestry treatment <table><tr><td>Depth</td><td colspan=\"4\">Tree species used in linear agroforestry system</td><td/><td/><td>Overall</td></tr><tr><td>(cm)</td><td>Control</td><td colspan=\"2\">C. equisetifolia</td><td>G. robusta</td><td>M. eminii</td><td>M. lutea</td><td>(g C kg -1 )</td></tr><tr><td/><td>(g C kg -1 )</td><td>(g C kg -1 )</td><td/><td>(g C kg -1 )</td><td>(g C kg -1 )</td><td>(g C kg -1 )</td></tr><tr><td>0-25</td><td>0.38</td><td>1.27</td><td/><td>1.26</td><td>1.45</td><td>0.48</td><td>0.96</td></tr><tr><td>25-50</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.77</td><td/><td>1.97</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.04</td><td>0.97</td></tr><tr><td>50-100</td><td>0.49</td><td>1.38</td><td/><td>1.48</td><td>0.86</td><td>-0.45</td><td>0.73</td></tr><tr><td>Overall</td><td>0.43</td><td>1.13</td><td/><td>1.56</td><td>1.13</td><td>0.38</td><td>0.93</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">n = 240 for each soil depth, Mean = Least square means</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Table 7 Soil organic carbon stocks in a linear simultaneous</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Treatment</td><td/><td>SOC (Mg C ha -1 )</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Pre-planting</td><td colspan=\"2\">Post-harvest</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Control (no trees)</td><td>153.65</td><td>150.47</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Casuarina equisetifolia</td><td>280.30</td><td>263.35</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Grevillea robusta</td><td>316.85</td><td>291.84</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Maesopsis eminii</td><td>317.86</td><td>300.58</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Markhamia lutea</td><td>283.87</td><td>279.03</td><td/><td/><td/></tr></table>] ).

There was a significant (P \\ 0.05) difference in SOC among the indigenous species, with Maesopsis eminii having more SOC than Markhamia lutea. Differences in SOC found between exotic and indigenous species may be due to the varying abilities of trees to capture soil nutrients, varying amounts of litter fall and root distribution, different rates of decomposition and other resources under different environments (Huxley 1999) . In addition, the amount of litterfall and differences in the litter decomposition rates among the different tree species may also influence SOC. The study conducted by Wajja-Musukwe et al. (2008) in Uganda at the same site, indicated that there were differences among the growth rates and form of the these tree species. Wajja-Musukwe et al. (2008) , also showed that there were significant differences between species in the mean number of main roots in the trench, were G. robusta had more main roots per tree than the other species, which could contribute the difference in SOC among the tree species.\n\nThere was significant variation in SOC with soil depth, where more SOC was observed at 0-25 cm soil depth and the least amount was measured at 50-100 cm. This indicates that SOC decreases with increasing soil depth in the linear simultaneous agroforestry systems. This result may be related to the decrease in root numbers with increasing depth in the soil profile and distance from the tree row (Wajja-Musukwe et al. 2008) . This study also noted that the soil profile under M. eminii showed maximum number of roots at a depth of about 0.45 m, whereas roots of other species (C. equisetifolia, M. lutea, and.G robusta) were most numerous closer to the soil surface. A study on alley cropping with hybrid poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) found that SOC and N were not evenly distributed throughout the plow layer but the largest C and N pools occurred in top 20 cm of the soil horizon, which was attributed to the recent adoption of conservation tillage and no-till promoting the accumulation of SOC and N (Oelbermann and Voroney 2007) . However, in this study decrease in SOC may be due to the decrease in the rate of activities (biological and physical) as soil depth increases. More still, the spatial pattern of organic carbon stocks has been observed to be controlled by the distribution of root litter and the sorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the depth increments (Scho ¨ning et al. 2006) . Therefore, low spatial variation of SOC at soil depth below 12 cm was attributed to the high small scale variability of pore distribution and distribution of aluminum and iron (Scho ¨ning et al. 2006) . When change in SOC between before planting and after harvesting was analyzed, results showed that there was a greater loss in SOC in the top 25 cm compared to the deeper soil depths. Factors known to cause a loss in SOC (such as precipitation, soil temperature, tilling, etc.) affect the top layers of the soil more than at deeper soil depths.\n\nSoil bulk density ranged from 0.49 to 2.38 Mg m -3 , with the average soil bulk density of the area was 1.69 Mg m -3 and standard deviation of 0.35 Mg m -3 . Soil bulk density varied significantly among the treatments and soil depth. The overall assessment of soil bulk density shows that mean soil bulk density increases with increasing soil depth and inversely with SOC, as has been previously observed (Don et al. 2007) . Although there was no significant direction effect in this study, our results indicate a significant interaction between direction and distance before planting maize. This implied that as the distance from the tree increases, changes in SOC are not the same in the east-west directions. For all the data sets, there was more SOC in the western direction (sunset) than the east (sunrise) for Casuarina equisetifolia, Markhamia lutea, and Grevillea robusta at distances of 7.5-12.5 m away from the tree row, whereas Maesopsis eminii plots had more SOC on the eastern side than the west for distances closer to the tree row (0-7.5 m). This could be due to the differences in orientation and size of the tree crown as well as the varying root architecture among the tree species. Overall SOC within 100 cm surface for all the trees species was higher than the control plot with no trees. This may be due to the presence of trees which contribute more leaves, forage and branch litter as well as the amount of roots that decompose as compared to control plots with trees only. However, the SOC (Mg C ha -1 ) values obtained under a linear agroforestry system in Uganda are relatively higher than those reported by others (e.g., Dixon 1995; Montagnini and Nair 2004; Mutuo et al. 2005; Winjum et al. 1992 ). This may be due to the factors such as species used and tree density (Dixon 1995; Montagnini and Nair 2004 ) that influences the potential of an agroforestry system to sequester carbon. Others factors that may influence the amount of SOC stored include agroforestry management practices, age of the trees and environmental factors.\n\nAlthough this is a baseline study, the results indicate that linear simultaneous agroforestry systems have significant potential to increase soil organic carbon compared to control plots with no trees or crop only. There was no significant difference in the amount of SOC among the exotic and indigenous tree species. Soil bulk density varied significantly among the treatments and with soil depth. Among the exotic species, Grevillea robusta had more SOC than Casuarina equisetifolia. There was a significant difference in SOC among the indigenous species, where Maesopsis eminii had more SOC than Markhamia lutea. There was more SOC in the western direction (sunset) than the east (sunrise) for Casuarina equisetifolia, Markhamia lutea, and Grevillea robusta treatments at distances far from the tree row, whereas Maesopsis eminii plots had more SOC on the eastern side than the west for distances close to the tree row. Distance from the tree row did not significantly influence soil organic carbon concentration for the treatments. In selecting a tree species to integrate with crops as well as sequestrating reasonable quantities of carbon, a farmer can either plant an exotic or an indigenous species. Among the treatments studied, integrating trees and crops have a higher potential to sequester carbon than crop only. In this study, Grevillea robusta and Maesopsis eminii have the highest potential to store organic carbon in the soil compared to other tree species. It is recommended that further studies be conducted to assess the changes in SOC over the long-term.\n\nAgroforestSyst (2012) 84:11-23"}
