                "text": "1 Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry Nauni, Solan, Himachal Pradesh. *Corresponding author email: harish.s2077@gmail.com Himachal Pradesh (HP) is a mountainous state located in western part of Himalayas and is characterized by the diverse agro-ecosystems with altitude varying from 350-6975 m amsl (Gupta et al. 2017) . Agriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state with 69% of the main workers engaged in the agricultural activities and 75% of the total reporting area is available for cultivation. Hill farming systems are dominated by small-scale and subsistence agricultural groups as about 89% of the landholdings in HP are constituted by marginal and small farmers (GoHP 2021). In comparison to larger and more financially oriented farms, these farmers have distinct land management goals and limits. Planting trees on farms helps farmers to satisfy their multifarious needs, which leads to increase in tree cover and thereby reducing the burden on existing forests. Being influenced by physiography, the climate within state varies greatly with some areas being warmed significantly during summers, while, some being covered with snow during winters resulting in the state being classified in four agro-ecological zones. In recent years, changing climate, population increase and decreased land holdings has called for the development of land use systems that reconcile agricultural production with the provisioning of ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation. Agroforestry provides end-to-end link between sustainability and profitability along with greater opportunities for the sustained productivity to tackle such problems. However, the adoption of agroforestry technologies depends on the edapho-climatic, socioeconomic status and farmer needs, and management is influenced by physical, demographic and institutional factors (Bayard et al. 2007) . Studies report that low lying areas of HP are highly exposed to the changing climatic conditions (GoHP 2012). Chamba district of HP is categorized by mountainous landscape ranging from 2000 feet to 21000 feet and is least explored for its agroforestry resources. So, keeping in mind the extent of exposure to climate change and the role of agroforestry in addressing the climate change effects, the study was carried out with the objectives of identifying the prevalent agroforestry systems (AFS) and to assess their carbon stock potential.",

                "text": "The findings revealed that five AFS were prevalent in the study area, viz. agrisilviculture (AS), agrihorticulture (AH), agrisilvihorticulture (ASH), silvopastoral (SP) and pastoralsilviculture (PS). Depending upon the functional components AFS can take numerous forms which are generally the result of primary needs of the society, topography, climate, edaphic conditions, biotic factors as well as economic aspects. The tree density and proportionate area under tree component in different systems varied from 50 (pastoralsilviculture) to 157 (silvopastoral) per ha and 0.20 (agrihorticulture) to 0.65% (silvopastoral), respectively. Among the prevalent AFS in the study area, the specific agricultural components consisted of Zea mays (Makki), Triticum aestivum (Kanak), Hordeum vulgare (Jau), Oryza sativa (Dhaan), Avena sativa (Jauvi), Capsicum annuum (Shimla mirch), Solanum lycopersicum (Tamatar), Solanum tuberosum (Baingun), Allium sativum (Lahsun), Coriandrum sativum (Ben), Brassica juncea (Sarson), Trigonella foenumgraecum (Methi) and Capsicum frutiscens (Pipli). In the present era when we are facing the adverse climatic conditions agroforestry in the form of traditional systems is cushioning our agroecosystems implicitly. The systems prevalent in the farmer field were mostly traditional having the higher proportion of forest species fulfilling the needs of the fodder, i.e. Grewia optiva (Beul), Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena), Ficus palmata (Dagla), Bauhinia variegata (Kachnar), Morus serrata (Toot), Prunus cerasoides (Paaja), Celtis australis (Khirak), timber, i.e. Toona ciliata (Tooni), Bombax ceiba (Semal), Melia composita (Drek), Dalbergia sissoo (Shisham), Punica granatum (Dadu), Tectona grandis (Sagwan), Celtis australis and fuel, i.e. Albizia chinensis (Black siris/Olha), Celtis australis, Leucaena leucocephala, Ficus palmata, Morus serrata, Grewia optiva, Bauhinia variegata, Pyrus pashia (Kainth) and Pistacia integerrima (Kakarsingi). However, with the changing scenario horti-based systems are being preferred by the farmers owning to the economic benefits, perennial nature, less management which also results in positive ecological benefits side by side. In the study area, various horti-based systems comprised Mangifera indica, Citrus limon, Litchi chinensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Psidium guajava, Carica papaya and Pyrus communis. Although, farmers are not much bothered about the climatic hazards as they are by the returns from the investment, so, if farmers can be motivated to adopt suitable agroforestry technologies based on their economic profitability and dual goals of raising farmer economy and addressing climate change can be fulfilled simultaneously. Topographically being hilly terrain, the conservation of the soil against erosion as well as stabilization of the farm bunds becomes important. Natural grasses retained on the farm bunds as well as adoption of the pasture based systems locally known as ghasnis, on the land left fallow is also of utmost importance. Major grasses present in the pasture based systems were Chrysopogon montanus, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris Forestry, Nauni, Solan (32\u00b011\u203230\" to 33\u00b013\u20326\"N and 75\u00b049 to 77\u00b03\u203230\"E), Himachal Pradesh. Three village panchayats were selected and from each panchayat 15 farmers were selected randomly comprised 5 farmers each from marginal, small and medium category. The AFS being practised by the selected farmers were identified on the structural and functional basis (Nair 1985) and named on the basis of the prime importance of the functional components.",

For the biomass estimation of the herbage, agricultural crops and shrubs, the destructive method of sampling was used. In case of agricultural crops and herbage, the vegetation found within the sample plot was uprooted and the aboveground and belowground portions were separated and oven dried at 70 o C till a constant weight was obtained. For the estimation of shrub biomass, the shrubs were uprooted and the branches were categorized into different size classes. Three branches from each size class were selected to assess the oven dried weight of the branches which on multiplying with the number of branches in each size class gave the total oven dried weight. For trees, non-destructive method of biomass estimation based on volume equations was used (FSI 1996) . The aboveground biomass (AGB) of the trees was estimated as: where BEF, Biomass expansion factor. Belowground biomass (BGB) of tree was calculated by multiplying its AGB with a standard factor of 0.26 (Cairns et al. 1997) . Biomass carbon stock was calculated by multiplying the biomass with the standard factor 0.5 (IPCC 2003) . For the estimation of soil carbon stock, five soil samples, one from the centre and four from the corners, were collected from the depth of 0-30 cm from the sample plot laid to form a composite sample. Soil samples were then shade dried, grinded to pass through 2 mm sieve and stored in cloth bags for further analysis. Soil organic carbon density was calculated by multiplying % organic carbon with bulk density and soil depth and expressed in Mg/ha. C (Mg/ha) = Soil bulk density (g/cm 3 ) \u00d7 soil depth (cm) \u00d7 OC (%) \u00d7 100",

(2021) , while, lower compared to the that reported by Gupta et al. (2017) and Panwar et al. (2022) in Himalayan region. Among all the systems, maximum (9.88 Mg/ha) BGB was obtained for silvopastoral which was at par with the agrisilvihorticulture (9.04 Mg/ha), while, minimum (5.11 Mg/ha) was obtained for pastoralsilviculture which was at par with agrihorticulture (5.39 Mg/ha). Results obtained were similar to the findings of Sharma et al. (2021) and Panwar et al. (2022) attributed to the species diversity, density, frequency, age of vegetation, management regimes, tree growth characteristics etc. Further, being a fraction of AGB, variations in BGB becomes inevitable and may depend on type of plant, root system, management practices as well as ecological conditions prevailing in the area (Rajput et al. 2015 , Chaturvedi et al. 2016) . For interaction, maximum (10.84 Mg/ha) and minimum (4.05 Mg/ha) BGB was obtained for silvopastoral and pastoralsilviculture system respectively, under small and marginal farmer category.",

(2022) and Sharma et al. (2023) also reported higher carbon stock under silvopastoral system attributed to tree density as well as management practices. However, important point to note here is that under pasture dominated system the carbon stock stored in soil was more as compared to vegetation carbon stock as can be seen from the higher soil:plant carbon ratio of 2.59 under pastoralsilviculture system. Higher soil organic carbon may also be due to the dominance of broadleaved tree species having deep anchored root system (Kumar et al.",

Higher soil organic carbon in silvopastoral system may be due to the litter addition as well as decayed root material in the soil as compared to the other systems. Soil organic carbon is also influenced by litter quality, geographic location, land use and management. Systems which are relatively older and undisturbed have potential to store higher carbon (Panwar et al. 2022) which may be the cause behind the higher carbon accumulation in soil under silvopastoral system. Similarly, higher soil carbon pool was reported under silvopastoral (Goswami et al. 2014) in Himalayan region. However, the results were contrary to the findings of the Singh et al. (2015) CARBON STOCK POTENTIAL OF AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS 2021). Similarly, Goswami et al. (2014) also reported higher soil:plant carbon ratio in non-arable land uses, viz. silvipasture and pure grassland, highlighting the protective role of these systems on soil on one hand, while the vulnerability towards higher carbon emissions under degraded conditions on the other hand. However, Rajput et al.

Biomass production as well as carbon stock potential was not influenced significantly by the type of the farmer category, but, agroforestry system. Biological productivity of the agroforestry land use was found higher for the system dominated by perennial component with silvipastoral system being most productive among all the systems and having maximum carbon stock emphasizing the potential role towards climate change mitigation. Further, carbon stock potential of the agrisilvihorticulture shows that diversified composition can be beneficial from economical as well as ecological perspectives.",
