This study addresses the potential for the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in traditional and newly introduced J. curcas production systems. Five prevailing systems included interplanting with annual crops, intensely managed monoculture plantations, afforestation of abandoned cropland, plantings along contour stone walls, and traditional living fences.\nThe SOC was analyzed in 20 paired sites of 1-to 4-year-old J. curcas plantings and adjacent cropland. Paired sites with living fences involved a longer chronosequence with 15-and 20-year-old plantings. Additionally, the contribution of J. curcas to SOC sequestration was investigated by comparing the 13 C signature of the C inputs in four J. curcas sites with that of sorghum cropping.\nLinear regression analysis did not reveal a clear trend of SOC dynamics over time for the short-term chronosequences, nor could the isotopic tracer technique prove a contribution of 4-year-old J. curcas trees to the SOC stock. The 20-year chronosequence of J. curcas living fences exhibited a significant SOC increase of 62 \u00b1 23 g m \u00c02 y \u00c01 .

On the other hand, soil carbon loss is accelerated by microbe-induced, termiteinduced, and temperature-induced rapid mineralization and decomposition rates of organic material and by leaching and erosion (Batjes, 2001) .

In Burkina Faso, where declining soil fertility represents a main threat to agricultural production (Vlek et al., 2008) , the contribution of J. curcas cultivation to soil amelioration through increased residue inputs and erosion control could be significant. However, scientific evidence on land reclamation by J. curcas is scarce (Gasparatos et al., 2012) . Experiments carried out so far show evidence of improved soil structure and potential for C sequestration in degraded soils in a 30-month-old J. curcas plantation (Ogunwole et al., 2008) and increased soil-C stocks in J. curcas hedgerows as opposed to neighboring fields (Soulama, 2008) .

Therefore, comparisons of soils under plantations with those under previous land use and under plantations of different ages are valuable methods for the detection of SOC change due to afforestation. The latter \"space-for-time substitution\" approach implies a soil chronosequence as a series of soils that develop in similar geological positions with comparable site factors except plantation age [Jenny (1980) cited in Richter & Markewitz, 2001] . Stable C isotope studies can furthermore help to detect subtle SOC changes due to the contribution of trees to soil organic matter in systems where the 13 C signature of the C inputs from afforested plots (C 3 plants) is different from the 13 C signature of the previous land use with C 4 plants (Nyberg & H\u00f6gberg, 1995; del Galdo et al., 2003) . Our study aimed to quantify the SOC dynamics in J. curcas systems as opposed to annually cultivated cropland (i) by means of comparing paired J. curcas-cropland sites in a chronosequence approach and (ii) through application of the 13 C natural abundance technique, where the land-use history allowed 13 C discrimination.",

These sites were predominantly characterized by shallow (53 \u00b1 7 cm) ferric lixisols, with sandy loamy texture in the topsoil and clay content increasing with depth (see Appendix S1 of the supporting information). Afforestation in the south-west also occurred on very shallow (<40 cm) leptosols and endoplinthic ferric lixisols containing over 20% of ferruginous gravel. Sandy loamy in upper horizons and more clayey with depth, these soils are particularly poor in plant-available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and, because of low productivity, abandoned from agricultural activities several years before J. curcas planting. Within the Sudano-Sahelian AEZ, living fences of J. curcas have been traditionally planted to protect farm fields from animals. The hedges contain J. curcas shrubs of varying age (due to self-propagation), growing on 120+-cm deep lixisols with a sandy or silt-loamy texture. Further to the north, in the Sahelian AEZ, J. curcas has been planted since 2008 along the stone walls established against wind and water erosion. This area is characterized by >100-cm deep cambisols, clay-loamy in texture with clay content increasing in deeper horizons.",

Additionally, soils for the SOC analysis were sampled with a soil auger to a maximum depth of 60 cm according to the microsite sampling approach (Ellert et al., 2001) . The restriction of the sampling points to small microsites minimizes lateral variability and increases the precision in determining temporal changes in soil carbon (Ellert et al., 2001) . Thus, in two microsites (2 m \u00d7 2 m) per plantation, samples were collected at three points with an increasing distance from the tree stem (40, 120, and 200 cm) and bulked according to the sampling depth. This approach also aimed to account for differences in SOC caused by spatially variable rooting and leaf-fall patterns of J. curcas shrubs.",

                "text": "In contrast, the chronosequence consisting of cropland soil (0 years) and living fences aged 15 and 20 years showed significant but low linear correlation between SOC (R 2 = 0\u202238, p < 0\u202205) and living fence age in the top 20 cm. In deeper soil layers, no significant SOC stock increase over time was observed. SOC concentrations exhibited patterns similar to those of SOC stocks (Figure 4 ). The SOC masses of the cropping sites averaged 2\u20227 kg m \u00c02 and increased to approximately 4\u20220 kg m \u00c02 under mature living fences. The linear relationship for the 0-20 cm soil layers corresponds to an SOC accumulation rate of 62 \u00b1 23 g C m \u00c02 y \u00c01 . The increase was the highest for the top 10-cm soil layer. Expressed in SOC concentration, an annual 0\u202202% increase from the initial 0\u202284% resulted in an SOC of 1\u20222%. Assuming soil coverage of 1200 m 2 by living fences (400-m hedge fencing 1 ha with a mean width of 3 m), an SOC sequestration of 77 kg ha \u00c01 y \u00c01 can be expected. Over the period of 20 years, this accumulates to 1\u20225 t C ha \u00c01 . With 6\u20223 Mg C ha \u00c01 sequestered in the woody above-ground and below-ground biomass of J. curcas living fences over 20 years (Baumert, 2014) , the contribution of topsoil SOC sequestration to the total ecosystem C accrual was 19%. In comparison with annual cropping systems, such as maize and cotton where usually only the root biomass of ~0\u20222-0\u20223 Mg C ha \u00c01 (Tiessen et al., 1998) remains in the soil, J. curcas systems have substantial returns of organic material to the soil through the annual leaf fall. In general, in perennial systems with less soil disturbance, organic matter decomposition is slowed down. Eventually, high litterfall rates coupled with low decay rates lead to increasing litter stocks (Martius et al., 2004) and soil-C sequestration over time (Lal, 2004) . The observed increase in SOC of living fence systems is in line with the findings of Soulama (2008) that show an SOC mass increase in the 0-20 cm topsoil layer from 2\u20223 kg m \u00c02 in a cropping site to 3\u20227 kg m \u00c02 under a mature J. curcas living fence in the northern region of Burkina Faso. The observed values are high compared with the rates reported in the literature, for example, a global average accumulation of 33\u20228 g C m \u00c02 y \u00c01 in forests (Post & Kwon, 2000) , 10-20 g C m \u00c02 y \u00c01 in Senegal under best management practices (Batjes, 2001) , and 20-40 g C m \u00c02 y \u00c01 in arid and semi-arid agroforestry systems according to the literature review by Nair et al. (2009) . The findings of a metaanalysis by Guo & Gifford (2002) showed that land-use conversion from crop to plantation might cause a soil-C stock increase of 18% (estimated at 26% by Lagani\u00e8re et al., 2010) . This is substantially below the value of 48% calculated for the presented case. However, the high value can be explained given the localized planting with dense spacing in J. curcas living fences (<1-m distance between trees). Even though the share of SOC accumulation in the total C sequestration potential of living fences was high (19% over a growing period of 20 years), soil C sequestration in dry lands plays a negligible role in reducing the global C emission gap till 2100 (Batjes, 2001; Smith, 2008) . The incentive for J. curcas management leading to increasing SOC should therefore rather be seen in raising site productivity and soil fertility.",

However, consistent with the results on SOC content in paired J. curcas and cropping sites in recently introduced J. curcas plantations, the \u03b4 13 C signature of young J. curcas stands did not show significant amounts of newly C 3 -derived soil C (Table II ). The observed shift of the \u03b4 13 C signature to significantly lower negative values in the intercropping systems can probably be traced back to a thick weed (C 4 ) cover in the plantations. As weed can be a major source of soil organic matter and seasonal shifts in weed composition (proportion of C 3 and C 4 weeds) can occur, monitoring of the weed component would help to better understand the soil C contribution by trees (Diels et al., 2001) .",

In a sparse plantation of >15-year-old J. curcas trees where a young J. curcas intercropping system was integrated (sampling site 11, Appendix S1), parkland trees and ancient C 3 vegetation most likely contributed to the highly negative 13 C values observed (Table II ).

This value was corroborated by observable changes in \u03b4 13 C values, indicating a contribution of C 3 -derived C to total soil C. Even if no increase in SOC in the newly introduced J. curcas plantation systems could be discovered over the first years, long-term SOC accumulation can be expected on the basis of the high organic matter inputs through annual foliage deposition in contrast to annually harvested crop biomass. Longer-term measurements comprising standard soil analyses and 13 C natural isotope abundance should be undertaken in growing J. curcas plantations to investigate SOC changes over time. The equivalent soil mass approach is advisable for calculating SOC stock changes as the soils are characterized by high gravel content.",
