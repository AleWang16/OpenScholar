There was a strong correlation between the maize yield and the total amount of nitrogen applied, both from prunings and fertiliser, suggesting that a major reason for the observed benefit from alley cropping, particularly with Leucaena, was due to an improvement in nitrogen supply. Leucaena produced significantly more biomass, and its leaves had higher concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and lower C/N and C/P ratios than did those of Flemingia. There was also evidence that the trees had a beneficial effect on other soil chemical properties; under the hedgerows, particularly those of Leucaena, there were higher levels of organic carbon, Mg, K and ECEC, and pH values were also highest.\nIt is suggested that higher levels of organic carbon in the alley crop treatments were responsible for the improvements observed in soil physical properties. Lower bulk density, lower penetration resistance, and a higher infiltration rate and pore volume fraction were measured in the alley crops, although there was no significant change in the soil water release parameters.\nA deteriorating effect of constant applications of nitrogen fertiliser on soil fertility was observed; as the level of urea application increased, there were significant decreases in Mg, K and pH, increases in A1 and soil acidity, and higher penetrometer resistance.

                "text": "In Northern Zambia, government policy in the last decade has promoted maize production by the small-scale farming sector through the use of hybrid varieties and imported fertiliser, both heavily subsidised by donors [Stromgaard, 1984] . However, reduction of these subsidies in 1990 caused many small-scale farmers, unable to afford inputs, to return to the traditional chitemene and fundikila systems of cultivation. Evidence is also emerging that maize yields are declining despite increased rates of fertiliser application. A possible explanation suggested for this is soil acidification by the fertiliser [Bolt and Holdsworth, 1987] . For these reasons, if maize production is to be sustained in the region, alternative methods of maintaining soil fertility other than the sole use of fertiliser need to be developed. Alley cropping was suggested as one possible solution to the problem, and research began in 1984 at Misamfu Regional Research Station, Kasama, to assess its potential. Previous papers in this series have described the results from a number of trials evaluating the potential of alley cropping to maintain soil fertility in both maize production systems as well as the traditional chitemene and fundikila systems that may include maize during their cropping cycle [Matthews et al., 1991 [Matthews et al., , 1992a [Matthews et al., , 1992b]] . Results so far have not been encouraging; most trials showed a decline in crop yields in the alley cropping treatments after four years. It was suggested that this was a result of low tree biomass production, poor litter quality resulting in slow decomposition and nutrient release, and an inappropriate cropping sequence. However, in one trial lasting six years, it was found that Leucaena leucocephala, and to some extent Flemingia congesta, 1 consistently increased maize yields above the control treatment after initial amelioration of soil pH by liming [Matthews et al., 1992b] However, no significant changes in major soil chemical properties after six years of alley cropping could be measured, raising the question of how these yield increases were obtained.",

In each plot, sixteen penetrations were made in the outer rows and sixteen in the middle rows, and readings taken from 0--10, 10--20, 20--40, 40--60, 60--80, and 80--100 cm depths in the soil profile.",

The beneficial results described in Matthews et al. [1992b] using alley cropped Leucaena leucocephala in comparison to Flemingia congesta and Gliricidia sepium, seem, therefore, to be largely derived from the capacity of Leucaena to introduce nitrogen into the system through biological nitrogen fixation. In comparison to Flerningia, Leucaena contributed considerably more N, not only by producing higher levels of biomass, but also by having a higher level of N in this biomass. The data in Table 3 indicate that there was a net increase of around 32 kg ha -* in the level of soil mineral N to a depth of 40 cm, mainly in the form of NH +, with no significant differences between either tree species, N treatments, or sampling positions. Why there should be an increase in soil N over the season at all in the sole maize receiving no N fertiliser is difficult to explain, although Yamoah et al. [1986b] also found that soil N level increased in control treatments, along with an increase of nearly twice as much under an alley crop of Cassia, a non nitrogen-fixing species. The y-axis intercept in Fig. 2a indicates the presence of residual soil N from previous years; assuming the estimates above are correct, and that all of this soil mineral N eventually becomes available to the crop, there appears to be an adequate supply without further addition for some time. The trial has involved a maize/soyabean rotation for several years, probably the factor responsible for the presence of N in the soil in the absence of fertiliser and pruning applications. The slope of the line in Fig. 2a indicates that only 28% of each additional unit of applied N is used by the crop; the rest is presumably lost by conversion to microbial protein or by leaching, as volatilisation on these acid soils is expected to be negligible. It is interesting to note that Fig. 2a in this paper is essentially the same as Fig. 2 in Matthews et al. [1992b] ; when applied biomass is converted to the nitrogen equivalent, differences in response between the different fertiliser nitrogen levels disappear.",

Similar increases in organic carbon were found when the results of several alley cropping trails at the same site were averaged [Matthews et al., 1991] . The role of organic materials in improving soil physical, chemical and biological properties has been well reviewed in recent years [e.g. Allison, 1973] , and various studies have shown the beneficial effects of alley cropping on soil organic matter levels. For example, Kang et al. [1981 Kang et al. [ , 1985] ] and Kang and Wilson [1987] , in a trial lasting six years in Nigeria, observed that soil organic matter levels were maintained in the alley cropping plots, but declined in the control plots. Similarly, Handawela [1986] reported higher soil organic matter and nitrogen levels under Gliricidia maculatum alley crops in Sri Lanka than under maize only. Yamoah et al. [1986b] found that there was an improvement in soil organic matter levels in Cassia and Gliricidia alley crops compared to the control plots. This improvement occurred even when the prunings were not applied, suggesting a contribution from root residues.",

                "text": "The beneficial effect of organic matter on soil physical properties is due in part to the action of organic gums in binding soil particles into aggregates, leading to an improvement in soil structure with a balanced distribution of pore sizes. This contributes to improved permeability and aeration, and easier root penetration, and in turn provides favourable conditions for development of fine feeder roots and mychorrhizae, so increasing the efficiency of nutrient uptake. The effects of improved soil physical properties on crop yields have been well reviewed by Lal and Greenland [1979] . As Yamoah et al. [1986a] have pointed out, good physical properties may even be more important than the supply of nutrients; the nutrients released from prunings become useless if the physical conditions do not favour proper root development to take up these nutrients. The present study showed significant reductions in soil bulk density, increases in the pore volume fraction and infiltration rates, and lower penetration resistance in the Leucaena treatments. Simlar results are emerging from other alley cropping studies. Handawela [1986] measured lower soil compression strengths under a Gliricidia maculatum alley crop in Sri Lanka, while Yamoah et al. [1986b] found a decrease in bulk density under alley crops of Gliricidia, Flemingia and Leucaena in Nigeria. Hulugalle and Kang [1990] , and Kang and Ghuman [1989] have observed similar improvements in soil physical proper-ties under various alley crops. Lal [1989b Lal [ , 1989c] ] reported that, despite an increase in bulk density and penetration resistance and a decrease in infiltration rates in all treatments, the rate of deterioration of these properties was less in Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepiurn alley crop treatments, particularly the former. This was attributed to effects on soil structure and structural porosity. The increased moisture retention capacity of the topsoil found by several authors [e.g. Kang et al., 1985; Yamoah et al., 1986b; Lal, 1989b] was not found in the present work.",

Similar trends were reported by Kang et al. [1981 Kang et al. [ , 1985]] . Various other authors have also found evidence of an amelioration of A1 and acidity buildup by alley crops [e.g. Lal, 1989 @ Young [1989] has argued that it is unlikely that alley cropping can raise pH on naturally acid soils, but that further acidification may be checked by increasing the concentration of Ca and other bases in leaves brought up from the lower layers and recycled to the surface. The higher levels of Mg, K and ECEC in the alley crop treatments in the present study suggest that this may be occurring.",

Bolt and Holdsworth [1987] have reported a decline in maize yields in Northern Province, Zambia, despite increasing rates of fertiliser application, suggesting a deterioration in soil fertility as a possible reason. Certainly, urea is known to have an acidifying effect on soils [Mengel and Kirkby, 1987] . The decline in Ca, Mg, and K with higher fertiliser applications may have been due to the increase in maize yield removing more of these nutrients, emphasising the importance of balanced fertiliser applications. Adequate supply of one nutrient only may result in an induced deficiency of others.",

While it is essential that other tree species should be screened for their ability to produce high quantities of biomass in the region, future research should also not discard Leucaena as a potential alley cropping species. Although the use of large quantities of lime is impractical at present for small-scale farmers in Northern Zambia IMatthews et al, 1992b] , the results from this trial have shown that Leucaena Ieucocephala seems to need favourable pH conditions only to establish; subsequent growth continues with no further applications even with soil pH as low as 4.4. It might be possible, therefore, to develop techniques of applying lime only to the soil around the seed or seedling, thereby reducing the quantities of lime required.",
