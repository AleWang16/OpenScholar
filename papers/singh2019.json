    "abstract": "The present study was undertaken in two altitudinal ranges 365-635 m and 636-914 m above mean sea level covering sub-montane, low hills and sub-tropical regions of Himachal Pradesh, India. The two altitudinal ranges were selected because of having common eight land use systems viz., agriculture (T 1 ), horticulture (T 2 ), agrisilvicultural (T 3 ), silvopastoral (T 4 ), agrihorticulture (T 5 ), agrihortisilvicultural (T 6 ), forest (T 7 ) and grassland (T 8 ). The experiment was carried out to identify variation in different land use systems in terms of biomass production and carbon stock potentials. The maximum value of aboveground biomass (184.75 t ha -1 ), belowground biomass (47.84 t ha -1 ) and total biomass (232.59 t ha -1 ) was recorded in forest land use system. All traits of biomass followed the order of T 6 >T 2 >T 5 >T 3 >T 4 >T 1 >T 8.. Among the agroforestry systems maximum aboveground (66.46 t ha -1 ), belowground (20.84 t ha -1 ) and total biomass (86.48 t ha -1 ) were accumulated in agrihortisilviculture system. The values of above, below and total biomass showed declining trend with increase in altitude. Vegetation carbon density also decreased with increasing altitudinal range. Among agroforestry systems, maximum (90.10 t ha -1 ) total carbon stock was observed in agrihortisilviculture, which was 2.45, 4.42, 10.67 and 44.80% higher than agrihorticulture, silvopastoral, agrisilviculture and agriculture land use system.",

There is considerable interest to increase the carbon storage capacity of terrestrial vegetation through land-use practices such as afforestation, reforestation, and natural regeneration of forests, grasslands, silvicultural and agroforestry systems (Brown, 1996; Ghosh and Mahanta, 2014; Chatuvedi et al., 2016) . Finding low-cost methods to sequester carbon is emerging as a major international policy goal in the context of increasing concerns about global climate change (Montagnini and Nair, 2004) . Agroforestry has been recognized to be of special importance as a carbon sequestration strategy because of its applicability in agricultural lands as well as in reforestation programs (Cairns and Meganck 1994; Ruark et al., 2003; Roy, 2016) . Conceptually trees are considered to be a terrestrial carbon sink (Houghton et al., 1998) . Therefore, managed forests can, theoretically, sequester carbon both in situ (biomass and soil) and ex-situ (products). By including trees in agricultural production systems, agroforestry can, arguably, increase the amount of carbon stored in lands devoted to agriculture, while still allowing for the growing of food crops (Kursten, 2000) .",

Several studies from forests of Indian Himalayan region (Shah et al., 2014; Pala et al., 2012; Iqbal et al., 2014) and agroforestry (Rajput et al., 2015; 2016) have been carried out in the recent past to explore the compatibility regarding carbon stock storage. In recent years, the farmers and field professionals of sub-montane and low hills, sub-tropical zone of Himachal Pradesh have developed various agroforestry systems integrating with timber, fodder, fruit trees and field crops and can store more carbon than monoculture land use. The main components of these land use systems are cereal crops, legumes, vegetable crops, fruit trees etc. The main forest tree species which dots the landscape of this agro-climatic zone are Poplar, Eucalyptus, Grewia, Morus, Toona, Siris and Bamboos etc. These agroforestry systems and other land use systems need to be tested for their carbon storage potential and environmental suitability in order to quantify the relative importance of these land use systems in today's contest. Therefore, the present study was undertaken in different land use systems of sub-montane and low hills, sub-tropical zone of Himachal Pradesh to estimate the biomass and carbon stocks in different land use systems.",

Local volume equation developed for specific tree species and region were used for calculating the volume of the forest trees of the sample plot (FSI, 1996) . W here volume equation was not available for the concerned species, the general volume equations were used for volume (FSI, 1996) .The estimation of above ground biomass of woody trees was estimated by using expansion factors and specific gravity. The expansion factors for different species were available from previous literature (IPCC 2003; Rai et al., 2000) . Specific gravity was determined from the available literature (IPCC, 2003; Kaul and Sharma, 1983) . Wherever the specific gravity values were not available in that case the stem cores were taken to find out specific gravity which was used further to determine the biomass of the stem using maximum moisture method (Smith, 1954) .",

For this purpose, we visited orchard fields from time to time, when they were uprooting their orchards during winter. For each fruit tree crop we selected 20 trees. Each selected tree was then sectioned into secondary branches and main stem. The diameter of basal portion (with tree calliper) and fresh weight of each branch was determined in the field with the help of balance. After estimating the dry biomass of the each secondary branch, we developed non-linear regression equation between diameter and dry biomass of the branches. This regression equation was then used to estimate the dry weight of secondary branches of the sample trees of the sample plot.",

In the interaction effect between land use systems and altitudinal range, the above ground biomass declined with the increasing altitudinal range from A 1 to A 2 except in grassland in the present study. However, this decline was significant in agrisilviculture and silvopastoral systems only. Maximum (184.75 t ha -1 ) above ground biomass was found under forest land use system followed by agrihortisilviculture (66.46 t ha -1 ), horticulture (62.99 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (58.37 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (45.01 t ha -1 ), silvopastoral (34.49 t ha -1 ), agriculture (17.09 t ha -1 ) and grassland (2.43 t ha -1 ), respectively. Agrihortisilviculture system had 3.88 times higher above ground biomass over agriculture system. Irrespective of land use systems, A 1 (63.33 t ha -1 ) had significantly higher biomass than A 2 (54.57 t ha -1 ) (Table 2 ). Higher biomass production at lower altitude might be due to higher density of tree species in the systems, local climatic factors, higher fertility status because of their proximity to plains, management practices and differences in species composition (Rajput et al., 2015; 2016) .",

Among agroforestry systems, maximum below ground biomass production (20.02 t ha -1 ) was exhibited by agrihortisilviculture, and it was significantly higher than agrihorticulture (13.18 t ha -1 ), agrisilviculture (12.47 t ha -1 ) and silvopastoral (9.01t ha -1 ) systems (Table 2 ). Agroforestry systems (AFS) produced 1.84 to 4.09 times higher below ground biomass than agriculture land use system. In fact, recent studies indicated higher soil C stock (amount of carbon stored in soil) under deeper soil profiles in AFS compared to treeless agricultural or pasture land systems under similar ecological settings (Haile et al., 2008; Nair et al., 2009) . In this connection, AFS are expected to have a great impact on the flux and long term storage of C in the terrestrial biosphere (Dixon, 1995) as the area of the world under AFS will hopefully increase substantially in the near future.",

The incorporation of trees or shrubs in agroforestry systems increased the amount of carbon sequestered when compared to a monoculture field of crop plants or pasture (Sharrow and Ismail, 2004; Kirby and Potvin, 2007) .The above results indicated that biomass components viz., above and belowground biomass and total biomass produced by particular land use system was influenced by the age of the components-annual or perennial, type of crop, structure of the system, nature and number of woody components, etc. Nayak (1996) observed that aboveground biomass was influenced by the plant species and their densities.

The land use systems of horticulture (96.38 t ha -1 ), agrihortisilviculture (90.10 t ha -1 ), agrihorticulture (87.89 t ha -1 ), Silvopastoral (86.11 t ha -1 ) and agrisilviculture (80.48 t ha -1 ) remained statistically at par with one another (Table 4 ). Trees are known for their high potential for converting radiant energy into organic matter as compared to the annuals. Forest ecosystems store carbon in large, long-lived species and in species with dense wood (Bunker et al., 2005) . Agrihortisilviculture land management systems had several species with diverse growth habits, root systems, mineral requirements enabling optimum use of available space and resources (Huxley, 1983) and lesser intensity of weed as compared to other systems (Toky et al., 1989) .",

The lower altitude showed maximum vegetation carbon in all categories. It was approximately half of the vegetation biomass and also affected by the factors of the vegetation biomass. The higher values of these traits in this treatment combination might be ascribed to higher average age diameter of the tree component at this altitudinal range, nature of the functional component in question and intensity of management involved. Indeed, the average age of the timber trees was quiet higher than agricultural crop, fodder and fruit based land use systems. In addition to it, the biomass production and its removal was quiet high in field crops.",
