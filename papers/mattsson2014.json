    "abstract": "Homegarden agroforestry systems are suggested to hold a large potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is due to their multifunctional role in providing income, food and ecosystem services while decreasing pressure on natural forests and hence saving and storing carbon. In this paper, above-ground biomass carbon and tree species diversity of trees was quantified in homegardens around two villages in the dry south-eastern part of Moneragala district of Sri Lanka. A total of 45 dry zone homegardens were sampled on size, diameter at breast height, tree height and species diversity. Using allometric equations, we find a mean above-ground biomass stock of 13 Mega grams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha -1 ) with a large range among homegardens (1 to 56 Mg C ha -1 , n=45) due to a variation of tree diversity and composition between individual homegardens. Mean above-ground carbon stock per unit area was higher in small homegardens (0.2 ha, 26 Mg C ha -1 , n=11) and statistically different compared to medium (0.4-0.8 ha, 9 Mg C ha -1 , n=27) and large (1.0-1.2 ha, 8 Mg C ha -1 , n=7) homegardens. In total, 4,278 trees were sampled and 70 tree species identified and recorded. The Shannon Wiener index were used to evaluate diversity per homegarden and ranged from 0.76 to 3.01 with a mean value of 2.05 \uf0b1 0.07 indicating a medium evenly distributed diversity of sampled tree species. The results show a vast heterogeneity in terms of carbon stock and tree diversity within the less studied dry zone homegardens; results that contribute to more knowledge of their expansion potential as well as climate mitigation and adaptation potential. The results are also useful for whether homegardens should be considered to be included as an activity to enhance natural forest cover within Sri Lanka's newly commenced UN-REDD National Programme.",

Homegardens are prime examples of multi-functional landscapes: spaces that combine agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems and are in Sri Lanka defined as a complex sustainable land-use system that combines multiple farming components, such as annual and perennial crops, livestock and occasionally fish, of the homestead and provides environmental services, household needs, and employment and income generation opportunities to the households (Weerahewa et al. 2012) . Others, such as, Kumar and Nair (2004) and Nair and Kumar (2006) provide a similar definition and suggest that a homegarden includes the concept of intimate plant associations of various trees and crops, sometimes in association with domestic animals, and consequent multi-story canopy configuration around the homestead. Despite the lack of a uniform definition of homegardens they are second to shifting cultivation the oldest land-use systems worldwide that have evolved through centuries of biological and cultural transformation (Nair and Kumar 2006; Pushpakumara et al. 2012) . In recent years, there has been growing interest in agroforestry systems due to their large potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation and their role to mitigate household food security and nutrition from soaring food prices (Minang et al. 2012; Nair 2012; Galhena et al. 2013) .",

To identify such strategies, it is relevant to analyze quantitative information and estimates of tropical homegardens' ability to sequester and store carbon. Although, the importance and recognition of homegardens for carbon storage has been highlighted earlier (e.g., Kumar 2006; Nair 2012) there is still a lack of quantitative data on homegardens and their carbon content, especially in dry zone environments in Sri Lanka. Few studies have also related species diversity to ecosystem processes (Pushpakumara et al. 2012) . Since subsistence agriculture is predominantly practiced in the dry zone, the little research focus on dry zone homegardens warrants further investigation on this subject. Therefore, this paper focuses on assessing the amount and pattern of tree diversity and above-ground biomass (AGB) in homegardens around two selected villages in the southern part of Moneragala district in Sri Lanka. The objective is to investigate how the AGB carbon and tree diversity varies depending on parameters such as homegarden size, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height.",

They are dry, intermediate, and wet mean annual rainfall of less than 1,750, between 1,750 to 2,500 and over 2,500 mm, respectively (see Fig. 1 ) (MFE 1995) . In Sri Lanka, homegardens cover about 14% of the total land area (FAO 2009) . They are mainly privately owned and are managed through family labor using technologies that rely on rich local knowledge systems (Pushpakumara et al. 2010) . Sri Lankan homegardens provide staple foods, many kinds of fruits, vegetables, spices, fuelwood, fodder, timber, medicinal plants and occasionally livestock products throughout the year. Although being ancient land-use systems, governmental policies have recently encouraged establishment and expansion of homegardens in urban and sub-urban settings as a mechanism to reduce living costs and imports of food products, to enhance food security and maintenance of environmentally friendly-traditional agriculture methods. Examples include the most recent program \"Divi Neguma\" (Livelihood Development) that aim to establish 2.5 million homegardens to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables and to reduce vegetable prices by providing free seeds, fertilizer and technical advice (Kumari et al. 2009; Government of Sri Lanka 2011) . So far homegarden research in Sri Lanka has predominantly included various assessments of Kandyan homegardens located in the mid-country wet zone (Pushpakumara et al. 2010) .",

However, Mattsson et al (2013) estimated the carbon stock for dry zone Sri Lankan homegardens (Hambantota and Anuradnapura district) is ranging from 10 to 55 Mega grams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha -1 ) (mean 35 Mg C ha -1 ). For comparison, Kandyan homegardens in the wet zone had carbon stocks ranging between 48 to 145 Mg C ha -1 with a mean value of 87 Mg C ha -1 (ibid.) Homegarden diversity is by large controlled by ecological and socio-economic factors such as altitude, homegarden size, age of gardens, and personal preferences by the gardeners, market access and production intensity (Karyono 1990; Abdoellah et al. 2006; Nair and Kumar 2006; Peyre et al. 2006; Torquebiau and Penot 2006; Wiersum 2006; Pandey et al. 2007; Kehlenbeck and Maas 2008) . Ariyadasa (2002) estimated more than 400 different woody species in Sri Lankan homegardens. In 20 districts a total of 153,493 million trees have been recorded of which wet, intermediate and dry zone homegardens consists of 49, 37, and 14% of trees, respectively. The average density of trees in homegardens of Sri Lanka is varying from 20 to 475 trees ha -1 . The wet zone homegardens are considerably smaller in extent than dry zone homegardens but the total number of trees recorded within the wet zone is much higher due to the higher tree density (average of 260 trees ha -1 ) than those in the dry zone (average 125 trees ha -1 ). Higher species density has also been found in small homegardens than large homegardens (McConnell and Dharmapala 1973; McConnell 2003; Pushpakumara et al. 2012) .",

The topography is undulating lying between 50-70 meters above sea level. Together with three small villages of same size, Padikapuhela and Pilimihela belong administratively to Beralihela which had a population of 1,793 in 2001. The villages are located within the driest agroecological zone (DL1) in the country where the soils are predominately alfisols (Panagos et al. 2011 ). The mean annual temperature is 27 \u00b0C and the mean annual rainfall is 1,050 mm (Department of Census and Statistics 2010). Most rain falls during the north-east monsoon (Maha season) from October to January while the south-west monsoon (Yala season) lasts from May to August and bring less rain (Seo et al. 2005) . Subsistence agriculture from paddy rice, banana, homegardens and shifting cultivation is the main income sources for the villagers (Withanage, pers. comm.). The village was established during the Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project (KOISP) in 1979 -1986 (Nijman 1992) ) where the government established new irrigated land within the Kirindi Oya River drainage basin to increase of food production, employment and providing arable land (IIMI 1995) . Hence, natural water flows are scarce in the area but diversion of irrigated water from Lunugamvehera reservoir provides water sufficiently for crop cultivation of paddy and banana during both monsoonal seasons. The area is also located close to the Lunugamvehera National Park, and thus the area is prone to wildlife interaction with negative effects on yields. Recently, intensive infrastructure development including an international airport and road developments has taken place close to the study area through state and foreign aided funds with increased prices of property as a result. A tank renovation project has also lately been established in the village through a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grants community based adaptation project and is expected to increase the water table and provide enough water for agricultural practices in homegardens and shifting cultivation lands for the villagers in the dry seasons.

For comparison reasons, the homegardens were categorized into three size groups, namely small (0.2 ha), medium (0.4-0.8 ha) and large homegardens (1.0-1.2 ha). Given the lack of a standard approach and available allometric equations to estimate AGB for homegarden agroforestry systems in Sri Lanka, pan-tropical allometric equations developed for tropical natural forests were used. The allometric equation developed by Chave et al (2005) for dry zone forests (rainfall under 1,500 mm yr -1 ) was applied for individual trees using measured DBH and tree height as well as literature derived species-specific wood density of all sampled species (varying from 0.26-1.06 g cm 3 ) following Reyes et al (1992) and the Wood Density Database by Chave et al (2009) as input variables. In those cases wood densities were not found, a default value of 0.57 g cm -3 for the Asian region was used (Reyes et al. 1992) . For bananas and palms (primarily for Cocos nucifera) we used the equations developed by Arafin (2001) (cited in Hairiah et al. 2010) and Brown (1997) , respectively (Table 1 ).",

Shannon Diversity Index values usually range between 1.5 and 3.5 and seldom more than 4.5 (ibid).

The maximum diversity of an individual garden was recorded in a medium size garden and the minimum diversity was found in a small homegarden (Table 2 ).

No significant correlation between the SOC components and the terrestrial carbon components was found in our assessment (i.e., AGB, trees ha -1 , species ha -1 , size of homegardens, DBH or tree height). Hence, the SOC data was removed for further analyses. The remaining terrestrial carbon component did show significant correlation in several cases (Table 3 ). Since some of the parameters are directly correlated, such as size and trees or species ha -1 , it is worth noting that AGB correlate positively and significantly with trees and species ha -1 and height, while DBH shows no correlation. Further, the significant negative correlation between AGB and homegarden size suggests that the larger the homegarden the less carbon does the homegarden contain per unit area. ",

This is consistent with earlier findings (e.g. Kumar 2011 , Pushpakumara et al. 2012 ) although tree density is lower than those dry zone homegardens assessed in the study by Ariyadasa (2002) . Secondly, differences in carbon stock is a result of differences in tree diversity, management practices, homegarden age, site characteristics and composition differences (Montagnini and Nair 2004; Henry et al. 2009) . For example, in the large homegardens investigated in this study, farmers often use shifting cultivation practices to prepare and burn certain plots within the gardens for cash crop cultivation in the wet season with less tree densities as a result. Excessive shading from trees is also thought to have a detrimental effect on cash crop yields according to the homegarden owners.",

However, the mean AGB carbon (13 Mg C ha -1 ) is lower and the large range (1 to 56 Mg C ha -1 ) between individual homegardens is higher than values shown earlier from Mattsson et al (2013) . Dissanayake et al (2009) estimated the AGB carbon stock in homegardens in Kandy (90 Mg C ha -1 ) and Matale (104 Mg C ha -1 ) districts and Premakantha et al (submitted) reported that homegardens in Nuwara Eliya district contain 77 Mg C ha - 1 . All the latter estimates are located within the wet zone and intermediate zone, and as expected, these values are higher due to a higher level of plant diversity and a denser canopy structure than dry zone homegardens. Outside Sri Lanka, Kumar (2011) found that Kerala homegardens in India had AGB carbon stocks ranging from 16 to 36 Mg ha -1 . Estimates from Javanese and Sumatran homegardens (35 to 59 Mg C ha -1 ; Jensen 1993; Roshetko et al. 2002) as well as mature (>35-year old) agroforests (101 Mg C ha -1 ) are higher than our estimates, but similar to 9-year old Sumatran agroforests (14 Mg C ha -1 ; Roshetko et al. 2002) .",

This study also only considers trees, and the overall SWI would have been higher if all plants were included. The negative relationship between tree species richness and large homegardens is in keeping with Kumar (2011) although e.g. Abdoellah et al (2006) and Mendez et al (2001) found low correlation whereas Abebe (2005) , Kabir and Webb (2009) and Bardhan et al (2012) , found a positive relationship. Our negative relationship between tree species richness and large homegardens is probably a result of specific needs and preferences by the owner along with socio-economic factors. For example, in larger homegardens there are often distinct spatial arrangements between trees and crops, where most trees are planted around the house and low tree density areas are found towards the borders where cash crops such as bananas or leguminous crops are grown for imminent needs and local markets, hence lower tree diversity and tree density. In small homegardens on the other hand, homegarden owners often adopt more intensive management and denser planting in multiple layers, thus, higher tree species richness.",

This is not consistent with the findings of Saha et al (2009) who found that species richness could provide greater stability of the SOC. The positive relationship between the SWI index and AGB carbon stock for small-sized gardens in relation to the slightly negative relationship for large homegardens and AGB carbon suggests that small-sized homegardens hold higher carbon stock and species diversity, in line with Kumar (2011) and Pushpakumara et al (2012) . Therefore, expanding homegardens into degraded and low-productive lands (such as shifting cultivation lands) for increased ecosystem services and carbon stocks as suggested by Mattsson et al (2013) would thus be more beneficial through the provision of small homegarden units rather than larger units. Also, the traditional use of homegardens has been around homesteads inherently meaning close to where people live. For sustained and enhanced ecosystem services such as carbon storage through expansion, would require new management strategies, for example that homegarden systems integrate more commercial oriented example plantation of perennials through a combination of exotic and/or indigenous species.",

This implies that developed countries provide incentives and financial compensation to developing countries for climate change mitigation benefits from maintaining and enhancing forest biomass. Homegardens could in this context be considered to be included within an existing or new forest definition to lower greenhouse gas emissions directly (Minang et al. 2014) . Another option could be to further promote homegarden establishment by intensification or extensification on marginal lands and serve as important buffers for the remaining natural forests in areas that are experiencing pressure from increasing populations. Consequences at the household level for such programmes needs to be explored further to investigate possible tradeoffs between for example biodiversity, economic, nutritional and financial benefits. For best outcomes at the local level, schemes such as REDD+ could be linked to existing or emerging developing programs highlighting food security and market integration since associated finance coming out of emissions based implementation is unlikely to be of main concern for local farmers (Bernard et al. 2013) .",

The carbon estimates found here are reflecting the differences in tree density, tree diversity and management practices between individual homegardens. Furthermore, no correlation is found between soil carbon parameters and AGB carbon or diversity of trees.
