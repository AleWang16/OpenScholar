    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the amount and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) under a linear simultaneous agroforestry system with different tree species treatments. Field work was conducted at Kifu National Forestry Resources Research Institute in Mukono District, Central Uganda, in a linear agroforestry system established in 1995 with four different tree species and a crop only control treatment. Soil samples were collected in 2006 at three depths; 0-25, 25-50, and 50-100 cm, before planting and after harvesting a maize crop. The results indicate that an agroforestry system has significant potential to increase SOC as compared to the crop only control. There was no significant difference in the amount of SOC under exotic and indigenous tree species. Among the exotic species, Grevillea robusta had higher SOC than Casuarina equisetifolia across the entire depth sampled. There is significant difference in SOC among the indigenous species, where Maesopsis eminii has more SOC than Markhamia lutea. Distance from the tree row did not significantly influence SOC concentration under any of the tree species. In selecting a tree species to integrate with crops that will sequester reasonable quantities of carbon as well as boost the performance of the crops, a farmer can either plant an exotic species or an indigenous. In this study, the soil under Grevillea robusta and Maesopsis eminii have the highest potential to store organic carbon compared to soil under other tree species.",

In the humid tropics, the potential of agroforestry (tree-based) systems to sequester C in vegetation has been estimated to range between 25 and 70 Mg C ha -1 in the top 20 cm of soil (Mutuo et al. 2005) . In degraded soils of the subhumid tropics, improved fallow agroforestry practices increased topsoil C stocks up to 1.6 Mg C ha -1 above that of continuous maize cropping (Mutuo et al. 2005) .",

The altitudinal range where this species grows naturally is from 0 to 1,400 m asl with a mean annual temperature of 10-35\u00b0C and mean annual rainfall of 200-3,500 mm. The species prefers deep well-drained coarse textured soils (MacDicken 1994) . It grows in association with actinorhizal bacteria, through which it fixes atmospheric nitrogen. The tree has proteoid roots and forms association with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae. Grevillea robusta A. Cunn. is a deciduous tree, which grows up to 12-25 m tall and 80 cm dbh. The crown is conical and fairly open with moderate competition to crops. The tree trunk is straight and branches up to 15 m. The species grows at an altitudinal range of 0-2,300 m asl, requires a mean annual rainfall of 600-1,700 mm, mean annual temperature of 14-31\u00b0C and prefers medium texture soils, but establishes well in alluvial soils.

Highly competitive to crops, this species is found within an altitudinal range of 900-2,000 m, requiring a mean annual rainfall of 800-2,000 mm and a mean annual temperature of 12-27\u00b0C. It grows best on red loam soils but can tolerate well-drained acidic clay loams. It occurs naturally in lake basins and highlands of East Africa with high rainfall including Uganda (Katende et al. 1995) . Markhamia lutea grows rapidly in forest soils and the tree can attain a height growth rate of 2 m per year. The tree can be pruned and pollarded to reduce shading and can be coppiced at 1.7 m in height.",

All treatments were replicated four times in 24 plots, of which the tree plots measured 25 9 30 m while the control plots were 15 9 30 m wide. Alnus acuminata was not included in the study because of its poor growth in all the blocks. A buffer of 5 m between plots was created to reduce the edge effect between species plots.

The seedlings were planted in a row down the middle of the plot (25 m by 30 m) along an east-west axis at 1 m spacing, resulting in 24 trees per plot (Wajja-Musukwe 2003) . After 3 years of growth, the trees were thinned by removing every other tree and crown pruning was done to reduce shade by removing one-third of the crown before planting of the crops (Okorio 2000; Wajja-Musukwe 2003) . According to Wajja-Musukwe (2003) , the first root pruning was conducted in 1999, prior to sowing of crops to reduce below ground competition between crops and trees. Root pruning was repeated at 50 and 62 months after planting, the roots were pruned on one side of the tree row in each plot (Wajja-Musukwe et al. 2008) . During Wajja-Musukwe (2003)'s study, the plots were prepared by deep cultivation before onset of the rains, and weeded twice each season. Super phosphate (298 kg ha -1 ) and NPK (25, 5, 5; 149 kg ha -1 ) was applied before maize was sown. Details on average diameter breast height (dbh) and height of the trees at the time of this study can be obtained in (Tumwebaze 2008) . Much of this site had been under fallow since the last agroforestry experiments in 2000. The field site was visited on 5 June 2006 and it was learned that blocks three and four had been intercropped with maize for two seasons (1 year). Blocks one and two were still under fallow and had not been cropped since 2000.",

After collection and air drying, soil samples weighing 1.5 kg were transported to the Forest Soils Analytical Laboratory at SUNY ESF, Syracuse, NY for analysis. Samples were processed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and root fragments. After mixing, a subsample was withdrawn for analysis of soil organic matter by loss on ignition (LOI) (Bickelhaupt and White 1982) . Organic matter was converted to organic C concentration by using two conversion factors; 1.92 for top soil (0-50 cm) and 2.5 for subsoil (50-100 cm) (Nelson and Sommers 1996) .

Measurements from a single auger sample separated into various depth classes are expected to be correlated. In the experimental design this is considered as a repeated factor (repeated in space) and sampling at various distance perpendicular to the tree row is a repeated factor in space Schabenberger and Pierce (2002) hence the use of linear mixed model. The fixed effects were assessed at 5% significance level.

Similar results have been previously reported (Thevathasan Fig. 3 Variation in mean soil organic carbon before planting and after harvesting maize over different distances from tree row on the east and west side of the line of trees for a control (bare soil), b Casuarina, c Grevillea, d Maesopsis and e Markhamia, over all soil depths in a linear simultaneous agroforestry system in Mukono District, Central Uganda Gordon 2004; Soto-Pinto et al. 2007) . A study on the tree intercropping systems in north temperate regions found that the C sequestration potential in hybrid-Liriodendron tulipifera intercropping system was four times higher than that of conventional agricultural fields in the region (Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) , while a comparison of corn fields to Taungya, tropical-improved fallow, sub-tropical improved fallow, coffee-tree system and traditional agroforestry systems concluded that agroforestry systems contained more SOC than the corn field (Soto-Pinto et al. 2007) . The higher SOC found in the agroforestry systems compared to maize crop or bareland may be attributed to incorporation of more litter fall from the trees (i.e., leaves, branches and twigs) into soil that adds organic matter and improves soil quality. Below-ground, tree roots penetrate to deeper soil layers than crop roots and bring nutrients to the surface via leaf fall (Schroeder 1993) . The success of the intercropping system depends mainly on the capacity of the system components to maximize resource utilization, while at same time maintaining complementary interactions among them (Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) . It has been noted that perennial woody plants may possess a greater potential to exploit the below-ground environment directly than seasonal plants because, over multiple years, the root systems of woody plants can grow incrementally or parts of the root systems can be replaced in situ from season to season, hence increasing nutrient capture (Huxley 1999) . In addition, multistrata agroforestry practices will contribute litter from a mixture of species, providing a better nutrient balance in the soil as compared to monocropping systems, hence increasing soil organic matter in form of litter and root matter (Ong et al. 1996) . Woody species in agroforestry are capable of having better spatial and temporal utilization of available growth resources than annual species.",

The tree canopy in an agroforestry system provides shade and reduces evaporation from the soil. This shading effect also reduces temperature and provides a more moderate microclimate for crop growth. The tree canopy also provides shelter from wind, protects the soil from the impacts of heavy rain and helps to reduce soil erosion. Leaf litter acts as mulch and reduces evaporation, surface runoff and erosion, hence protecting the topsoil, which has more soil organic carbon and other soil nutrients. Therefore, agroforestry systems have a greater potential to increase soil organic carbon compared to the bareland or crop only practices. These characteristics may make agroforestry systems more resistant to climate change than monocropping systems.",

The results of this study are similar to previously reported research (Oelbermann and Voroney 2007; Peichl et al. 2006; Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) , in which no significant differences in the amount of SOC were found at varying distances from the line of trees. Thevathasan and Gordon (2004) reported that SOC did not change significantly in the three distance zones from crop trees (0-2.5, 3-8, 8-15 m) 6 to 8 years after tree planting. Furthermore, it was observed that 15 years after planting, Liriodendron tulipifera trees were 14 m tall and leaf biomass was evenly distributed across the crop alley to a distance of up to 15 m, which resulted in a slow increase in SOC in the middle of the crop alley (Thevathasan and Gordon 2004) . Oelbermann and Voroney (2007) noted that after 13 years of alley cropping with hybrid Liriodendron tulipifera, the SOC and N pools did not differ significantly with distance from the tree row, although a trend of a large SOC and N pool near the tree row was observed. Peichl et al. (2006) indicated that the non-significant change in SOC as distance increases from the tree row was due to height of the Liriodendron tulipifera tree (i.e., 18 m), where the C input from litterfall is distributed evenly across the width of the crop alleys. This pattern is similar to the trees in the linear simultaneous agroforestry system in the current study, where all the trees were, on average, greater than 18 m in height, except for Markhamia lutea, which is 15 m. Hence no marked trend in SOC was observed with distance from the tree row.",

There was a significant (P \\ 0.05) difference in SOC among the indigenous species, with Maesopsis eminii having more SOC than Markhamia lutea. Differences in SOC found between exotic and indigenous species may be due to the varying abilities of trees to capture soil nutrients, varying amounts of litter fall and root distribution, different rates of decomposition and other resources under different environments (Huxley 1999) . In addition, the amount of litterfall and differences in the litter decomposition rates among the different tree species may also influence SOC. The study conducted by Wajja-Musukwe et al. (2008) in Uganda at the same site, indicated that there were differences among the growth rates and form of the these tree species. Wajja-Musukwe et al.

This indicates that SOC decreases with increasing soil depth in the linear simultaneous agroforestry systems. This result may be related to the decrease in root numbers with increasing depth in the soil profile and distance from the tree row (Wajja-Musukwe et al. 2008) . This study also noted that the soil profile under M. eminii showed maximum number of roots at a depth of about 0.45 m, whereas roots of other species (C. equisetifolia, M. lutea, and.G robusta) were most numerous closer to the soil surface. A study on alley cropping with hybrid poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) found that SOC and N were not evenly distributed throughout the plow layer but the largest C and N pools occurred in top 20 cm of the soil horizon, which was attributed to the recent adoption of conservation tillage and no-till promoting the accumulation of SOC and N (Oelbermann and Voroney 2007) . However, in this study decrease in SOC may be due to the decrease in the rate of activities (biological and physical) as soil depth increases. More still, the spatial pattern of organic carbon stocks has been observed to be controlled by the distribution of root litter and the sorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the depth increments (Scho \u00a8ning et al. 2006) . Therefore, low spatial variation of SOC at soil depth below 12 cm was attributed to the high small scale variability of pore distribution and distribution of aluminum and iron (Scho \u00a8ning et al. 2006) . When change in SOC between before planting and after harvesting was analyzed, results showed that there was a greater loss in SOC in the top 25 cm compared to the deeper soil depths. Factors known to cause a loss in SOC (such as precipitation, soil temperature, tilling, etc.) affect the top layers of the soil more than at deeper soil depths.",

                "text": "Soil bulk density ranged from 0.49 to 2.38 Mg m -3 , with the average soil bulk density of the area was 1.69 Mg m -3 and standard deviation of 0.35 Mg m -3 . Soil bulk density varied significantly among the treatments and soil depth. The overall assessment of soil bulk density shows that mean soil bulk density increases with increasing soil depth and inversely with SOC, as has been previously observed (Don et al. 2007) . Although there was no significant direction effect in this study, our results indicate a significant interaction between direction and distance before planting maize. This implied that as the distance from the tree increases, changes in SOC are not the same in the east-west directions. For all the data sets, there was more SOC in the western direction (sunset) than the east (sunrise) for Casuarina equisetifolia, Markhamia lutea, and Grevillea robusta at distances of 7.5-12.5 m away from the tree row, whereas Maesopsis eminii plots had more SOC on the eastern side than the west for distances closer to the tree row (0-7.5 m). This could be due to the differences in orientation and size of the tree crown as well as the varying root architecture among the tree species. Overall SOC within 100 cm surface for all the trees species was higher than the control plot with no trees. This may be due to the presence of trees which contribute more leaves, forage and branch litter as well as the amount of roots that decompose as compared to control plots with trees only. However, the SOC (Mg C ha -1 ) values obtained under a linear agroforestry system in Uganda are relatively higher than those reported by others (e.g., Dixon 1995; Montagnini and Nair 2004; Mutuo et al. 2005; Winjum et al. 1992 ). This may be due to the factors such as species used and tree density (Dixon 1995; Montagnini and Nair 2004 ) that influences the potential of an agroforestry system to sequester carbon. Others factors that may influence the amount of SOC stored include agroforestry management practices, age of the trees and environmental factors.",

There was no significant difference in the amount of SOC among the exotic and indigenous tree species. Soil bulk density varied significantly among the treatments and with soil depth. Among the exotic species, Grevillea robusta had more SOC than Casuarina equisetifolia. There was a significant difference in SOC among the indigenous species, where Maesopsis eminii had more SOC than Markhamia lutea. There was more SOC in the western direction (sunset) than the east (sunrise) for Casuarina equisetifolia, Markhamia lutea, and Grevillea robusta treatments at distances far from the tree row, whereas Maesopsis eminii plots had more SOC on the eastern side than the west for distances close to the tree row. Distance from the tree row did not significantly influence soil organic carbon concentration for the treatments. In selecting a tree species to integrate with crops as well as sequestrating reasonable quantities of carbon, a farmer can either plant an exotic or an indigenous species. Among the treatments studied, integrating trees and crops have a higher potential to sequester carbon than crop only. In this study, Grevillea robusta and Maesopsis eminii have the highest potential to store organic carbon in the soil compared to other tree species. It is recommended that further studies be conducted to assess the changes in SOC over the long-term.",
