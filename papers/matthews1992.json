The greater part of the region is covered by miombo woodland, dominated by two tree genera, Brachystegia and Julbernardia, forming a 15-20 m high, single-story, light but closed canopy over a forest floor consisting mainly of Hyparrhenia and Digitaria grass species. The soils are generally acidic and low in inherent fertility, providing little support for permanent agriculture; local cultivators have, therefore, evolved forms of shifting cultivation characterised by short cropping periods and long fallows, known as chitemene and fundikila.",

                "text": "Chitemene has been well described by several authors [eg. Peters, 1950; Trapnell, 1953; Stromgaard, 1989] . It is a form of 'slash-and-burn' cultivation, but unique in that the lopped area is much larger than the cropped area. There is some evidence that the system is indigenous to the Zaire-Zambezi watershed, and that it was brought from that area during migrations in the 17th century [Stromgaard, 1989] . Although there are variations described by Stromgaard [1989] , the basic (or 'large-circle') form of chitemene is as follows. Branches are lopped from trees within the selected area between July and September, laid out to dry, and before the beginning of the rains in November, are gathered into a heap in the centre of the cut area. In general, the area of the heap is around 0.4 ha [Trapnell, 1953] , while the size of the cut area depends on the quantity of woody biomass in that area; where the regeneration period is long (30 years), it may be around 4 ha, but for shorter fallow periods may be as high as 11 ha [Peters, 1950] . The heap is burnt just before the first rains, with finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) usually being the first crop sown in the ash plot. The subsequent cropping sequence varies, but typically is groundnut (Arachis hypogaea (L.)), millet, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris (L.)) [see Trapnell, 1953] . Often cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is planted as an intercrop with the millet in the first year and harvested gradually from the third year onwards. When the field is exhausted after 4-5 years, it is abandoned and traditionally left fallow for 20-30 years [Mansfield, 1973] , and another field opened. Mansfield et al. (1975) estimated that the chitemene system could support between 2 and 4 persons per knl 2 depending on the amount of suitable land available.",

Detailed descriptions of the fundikila process are given by Stromgaard [1988] . It has been suggested that the system is a culmination of the breakdown of the chitemene system as the area became deforested by an increasing population [Stromgaard, 1989] . Briefly, the process involves the formation towards the end of the rainy season of mounds of grass (predominantly Hyparrhenia filipendula and Pennisetum purpureum) covered by earth on a previously fallowed site. The grass rots within the mound during the dry season, and at the start of the next rains the mounds are levelled, and finger millet planted. This may be followed in the second season by a variety of crops including maize (Zea mays (L.)), beans, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), and groundnuts.",

This has had the effect of increasing the cleared area relative to the cropping area, a reduction in length of fallow periods required for regeneration (25 down to 12 yrs), and changes in the frequency of opening up new gardens (previously 1 yr, now 2 yrs) [Chidumayo, 1987] . The improvement of chitemene and fundikila has been neglected due to the concentration on the hybrid-maize/ fertiliser based economy (see Part II), but with the increasing cost of imported fertiliser forcing many farmers to return to these traditional systems, it is clear that there is an urgent need to improve their productivity and sustainability.",

The mean annual rainfall is 1360 mm, and the mean monthly temperature ranges from 18 \u00b0C to 23 \u00b0C. The rainy season starts in November and ends in April, followed by a cool dry season from May to July, and a hot dry season from August to October. 'Pan evaporation' (IEt) is around 5 mm d -1 in the rainy and cool dry seasons, rising to 8 nun d -1 in the hot dry season. The dominant soils, classified as Orthic Ferralsols (FAO classification), are derived from non- basic rocks, and are strongly leached.

In the subplot treatments receiving SSP, available P was significantly lower in the 0-20 cm layer, but significantly higher in the 20-40 cm layer, again suggesting some migration.",

A number of other studies have reported similar results; Lal [1989b] found in alley cropping trials in Nigeria that whereas there was a general decline in maize and cowpea yields over a 6 year period, maize yields were lower in alley cropped treatments than in the control. Singh et al. [1986] reviewing results for a number of alley cropping trials in semi-arid areas of Southern India found that alley cropping decreased overall yields of various crops. Work on acid soils at Yurimaguas, Peru, also showed lower yields of maize, cowpeas and rice in alley cropping treatments compared to the control [Szott, 1987] . On the other hand, some successes have been recorded, mainly with the tree species Leucaena leucocephala [eg. O'Sullivan, 1985; Watson and Lagnihon, 1985; Kang et al., 1985] . Similarly, Yamoah et al. [1986b] reported significant increases in crop yield with Flemingia congesta in Nigeria. These are discussed in more detail in Part II of this series. It is noteworthy that in all of these studies and in the present work, the yields of leguminous crops such as cowpea and groundnut were depressed by alley cropping, suggesting these crops were fixing adequate quantities of nitrogen by themselves, and that the presence of the trees only represented unnecessary competition.",

                "text": "In the chitemene trial (D11), the levels of most soil nutrients were slightly lower in the 'tree' treatments than those without, suggesting that there may be competition between trees and crop. In trial D21 there was slight evidence that alley cropping may have enhanced nutrient levels, but in trial D22, there was no difference in nutrient levels between alley cropping treatments and the control. However, as none of these differences were significant, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions. Results from other studies are also not consistent. Szott [1987] observed that there was less P, K, and Ca + Mg in the surface soil of the alley cropping treatment than in the control treatments in the Yurimaguas trials, and concluded that one of the reasons for lower yields in the alley crops was due to root competition for nutrients. Lal [1989a[ in alley cropping trials in Nigeria found that while soil organic matter, total N, pH, and exchangeable bases declined and total acidity and A13+ increased significantly in all treatments, these trends were least marked in the Leuceana leucocephala alley crop. Both Yamoah et al. [1986c] and Kang and Wilson [1987] , however, found a significant improvement in soil chemical properties under alley cropping in Nigeria. Lal [1989b] points out that the 'nutrient recycling' attributed to alley cropping is unlikely if the subsoil is extremely low in nutrients and there is little to recycle. Various authors have stressed the need for addition of fertiliser to low fertility alley cropping systems leg. Sanchez and Benites, 1987; Yamoah and Burleigh, 1990] . However, although the soils in Northern Zambia are of low fertility, both the chitemene and fundikila systems result in considerable localised enrichment of soil fertility. For example, measurements by Stromgaard [1984] indicate that the chitemene burn was equivalent to the addition of 176 kg ha -1 N, 346 kg ha -1 P, 433 kg ha -1 K and 308 kg ha -1 Ca to the soil. In the present work there was a substantial increase in the level of most soil nutrients after burning (Fig. 3 ). Similarly in fundikila, Stromgaard [1990] found that after one year, the mounds had significantly higher content of available cations than the surrounding flat-cultivated area, and after four years of a legume/cereal rotation on mounds alternating with flat cultivation, more nutrients had accumulated in the mound than were present before in the fallow. There are therefore considerable quantities of nutrients for alley crop trees to potentially recycle, particularly the highly mobile K which is leached back to pre-burn levels in the chitemene after one year [Stromgaard, 1984] . Losses of both P and K were evident in the present work, and were even slightly larger in the treatments with trees than those without (Fig. 3 ). In both fundikila trials, there was no difference in levels of P and K between the control and the alley crop treatments; there was also no statistical interaction between tree treatments and the addition of P fertiliser in trial D22. These seems to be little evidence, therefore, that nutrient recycling of any significance was occurring.",

In the studies where alley cropping has been shown to benefit crop yields, tree biomass production has been in the order of 6-8 t ha -1 y-1 using Leucaena leucocephala [Kang et al., 1985] . For Flerningia congesta, Budelman [1988b] recorded an annual dry matter production of 12.4 t ha y-~ in the Ivory Coast, while Yamoah et al. [1986b] measured 16.9 t DM ha -1 for Flemingia congesta in Nigeria. In the present work, however, although Flemingia congesta produced a maximum of 3 t ha -~ y-a in trial Dll, the mean annual production of all the species was only 1.3 t ha -1 y-i. Tree biomass production in Northern Zambia, therefore, appears to be considerably lower than elsewhere, a factor which may have been partly responsible for the lack of effect on crop yields.",

As a C/N ratio of less than 10 is generally regarded as necessary to prevent the immobilisation of N by the incorporation of organic matter into the soil [Budelman, 1988a] , addition of Flemingia prunings may actually reduce rather than increase the level of N available to the crop. Flerningia also had the lowest overall level of nutrients (Table 3 ). Thus, the low quality of Flemingia prunings may have also been responsible for the lack of effect on crop yields. In the work of Yamoah et al. [1986b] , there was no difference in alley cropped maize yields whether Flemingia prunings were added or not.",

                "text": "Biomass quantity and quality together determine the contribution of nutrients made to the soil by the prunings. However, the net benefit to the system must take into account the fact that most of these nutrients have come from the system itself. The average amount of nitrogen added through the prunings was 40 kg ha -1 y--1 N (Table 4 ). If it is assumed that about 35% of this was fixed biologically [Sanginga et al., 1989] , then this represents about 14 kg ha -1 y-1 N being added to the system, only 13% and 35% of the recommended N addition for maize and finger millet respectively [LIMA, 1991] . A significant proportion of K was added by the prunings, but P, Ca and Mg were present in the prunings in such low levels that their contribution to crop requirements was small. A proportion of each nutrient may have been brought from lower layers the crop could not reach, but further work is required to determine the importance of this source. However, the observations of Kessler and Breman ]1991 ] that many trees have very low fine-root densities below the crop rooting zone would suggest that the contribution from lower layers is small. Thus, the only benefit of alley cropping we can be reasonably sure of is the fixation of a relatively small amount of nitrogen, even less of which will be available to the crop due to losses from volatilisation, leaching, and manufacture of microbial protein. It would appear that the effective contribution of alley cropping to meeting crop nutrient requirements is comparatively small. Synchronisation of nutrient release with plant growth demands is also important. With most crops, the greatest nutrient demands are in the first five weeks of growth [see Yamoah et al., 1986a] , and demand lessens after this. The first pruning of the trees in the present work was at the onset of the rains after a long dry season in which there has been little growth, and there is a high wood and low leaf content. Decomposition is therefore slow, and the crop probably does not receive all the released nutrients when it needs them. In the second and third prunings, when there is substantial growth of readily decomposable leaf tissue, crop demands have lessened. Loss of these nutrients through leaching by the heavy rainfall at this time is highly likely. A potential improvement in the timing of pruning may be to shift the first pruning to the end of the previous season near the harvest. A variation of the fundikila technique could be employed in which tree prunings are incorporated in mounds or ridges at the end of the rainy season, allowed to decompose over the dry season, and levelled at the beginning of the next rainy season in preparation for the crop. In this way, high quality tree biomass is incorporated into the soil in the previous season, and as leaching losses are minimal over the dry season, would be available when crop demand is highest.",

Thus, in a five year cropping period, there is only one year in which alley cropping might be expected to have any effect on crop yields. Farmers may be unwilling to invest capital and labour in planting and maintaining trees for such a small return. Of course, if alley cropping had shown some potential in maintaining soil fertility, it may have been possible to include extra cereal crops in the sequence.",

In all trials, after four years of alley cropping, there was a significant decline in crop yields compared to the control. It was felt that this was probably due to the low biomass production of the trees, poor litter quality, particularly of Flemingia congesta, and possibly unsynchronised nutrient release. It is suggested that future research should address these problems by focusing on the screening of new tree species for greater biomass production under the prevailing conditions, and on exploring ways of improving alley cropping management techniques.",
