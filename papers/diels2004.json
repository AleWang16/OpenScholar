    "abstract": "Scanty information on long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics hampers validation of SOC models in the tropics. We observed SOC content changes in a 16-year continuously cropped agroforestry experiment in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. SOC levels declined in all treatments. The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where SOC levels dropped from the initial 15.4 to 7.3-8.0 Mg C ha 21 in the 0 -12 cm topsoil in 16 years. In the two continuously cropped alley cropping (AC) systems, one with Leucaena leucocephala and one with Senna siamea trees, SOC levels dropped to 10.7-13.2 Mg C ha 21 . Compared to the no-tree control treatments, an annual application of an additional 8.5 Mg ha 21 (dry matter) of plant residues, mainly tree prunings, led to an extra 3.5 Mg C ha 21 (,0.2% C) in the 0 -12 cm top soil after 11 years, and 4.1 Mg C ha 21 after 16 years. The addition of NPK fertilizer had little effect on the quantities of above-ground plant residues returned to the soil, and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of SOC decomposition. The fact that both C 3 and C 4 plants returned organic matter to the soil in all cropping systems, but in contrasting proportions, led to clear contrasts in the 13 C abundance in the SOC. This 13 C information, together with the measured SOC contents, was used to test the ROTHC model. Decomposition was very fast, illustrated by the fact that we had to double all decomposition rate constants in the model in order to simulate the measured contrasts in SOC contents and d 13 C between the AC treatments and the no-tree controls. We hypothesized (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction on this site, having a sandy top soil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type, is lower than assumed by the model.",

Because of the contribution of SOM to CEC, buffering capacity, soil structure, and water holding capacity, higher SOM levels could raise efficiencies of mineral fertilizers. A better understanding of long-term SOM dynamics can therefore significantly contribute to the current renewed research on the benefits of combining synthetic and organic sources of plant nutrients. Improved predictive capabilities moreover would allow for more precise assessment of the carbon sequestration potential in tropical soils.",

Unfortunately, only a limited number of studies (Woomer, 1993; Parton et al., 1994; Myers, 1995; Vallis et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2000; Gijsman et al., 2002) have tested SOM models against longterm data from tropical regions. Most if not all SOM models were developed using long-term data from temperate regions only. The particular mineralogy of many tropical soils and the lack of understanding of its influence on SOM stabilization (Merckx et al., 2001) , underscores the need for model validation using long-term data from the tropics, a task which is hampered by the limited availability of welldocumented long-term experiments.",

The method, developed by Cerri et al. (1985) , is based on the fact that plants with a C 3 photosynthetic pathway have a 13 C abundance ranging between 2 24 and 2 34\u2030, while C 4 plants range between 2 6 and 2 19\u2030 (Smith and Epstein, 1971) . Because the 13 C abundance of incoming plant material is largely preserved during mineralization and humus formation, the 13 C content of the SOC reflects the 13 C content of the vegetation. If a change occurred from a C 3 to a C 4 vegetation or vice versa at a known time in the past, it is possible to infer the turnover time of the SOC originating from the first vegetation type from the present 13 C content of the SOM.",

Since 1986, the AC cropping systems and the control have been continuously cropped with maize during the first growing season (May -July) and cowpea during the second growing season (September -November), except for 1992 when the field was left fallow in the second season. The experiment was established on an Episkeleti-Ferric Lixisol (Chromic) (ISSS-FAO-ISRIC, 1998) on the experimental farm of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, SW-Nigeria (7830 0 N, 3854 0 E). The experimental field had a 6% slope. Farm records indicated that between 1975 and 1981 the land has been used for annual crops (maize, cowpea), and left under grass fallow from 1982 to 1986. The plot of land is visible as arable land free of shrubs or trees on aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 1979. Prior to the establishment of the IITA experimental farm in 1967, the land has been used by smallholder farmers, who presumably practiced a bushfallow system. Ibadan has a bimodal rainfall, with an annual mean of 1278 mm, and a mean annual temperature of 26.2 8C. The trial was set up as a randomized complete block design with five replications and six treatments: the above-mentioned three cropping systems with and without fertilizer. The experimental plots measured 19.5 \u00a3 10 m. Yearly additions of urea (120 kg N ha 21 ), single super phosphate (40 kg P ha 21 ) and muriate of potash (25 kg K ha 21 ) comprised the fertilizer treatments. From 1994 onwards, these levels were decreased to 60 kg N ha 21 , 16.2 kg P ha 21 , and 15 kg K ha 21 . The trees in the AC systems were planted 4.5 m between the rows and 0.5 m within the rows at the beginning of the growing season in 1986, first pruned in 1987, and then regularly pruned 3-4 times a year. Tree prunings, excluding woody stems . 10 mm, were left on the plots. Tillage consisted of loosening of 3-5 cm of topsoil with a hand hoe prior to planting and at each manual weeding operation. Weeds were managed with a combination of a single herbicide spraying before each maize and cowpea planting and subsequent manual weeding (3 -4 times during the first season, twice during the second season). All weed residues were left in the plots. At harvest, the maize and cowpea residues were left on the plots. The only exceptions were that the 1986 maize residues were removed from the plots that received NPK fertilizer, and that the 1988 and 1989 residues were redistributed between all plots to obtain the same application rate in all plots (3.59 Mg DM ha 21 in 1988 and 6.15 Mg DM ha 21 in 1989). Full details of the management of this long-term experiment are given by Van der Meersch et al. (1993) for the 1986 -1990 period and Vanlauwe et al. (2004) ) for the 1986 -2002 period.",

The maize stover produced and applied in 1987 was taken as the average of the 1986 and 1988 production. As there were no data on the cowpea biomass yields for the years 1986-1991, the mean of the biomass measured for 1993-1997 was taken instead.

ROTHC-26.3 is a model of the turnover of organic carbon in soils on a time scale of years to centuries. It allows for the effects of clay content, temperature, moisture content, and plant cover on decomposition. The model mimics decomposition by defining four active SOC compartments and a small inert compartment (IOM). The four active compartments are decomposable plant material (DPM), resistant plant material (RPM), microbial biomass (BIO), and humified organic matter (HUM). These four active compartments decompose following first-order kinetics, while the IOM compartment is resistant to decomposition. The effect of plant litter quality is handled by specifying how the carbon for a particular incoming material is split over the DPM and RPM compartments.",

As prunings consist of woody twigs (, 10 mm diameter) and easily decomposable leaves, we choose a value (0.82) intermediate between the 1.44 value recommended for improved grassland and agricultural crops, and the 0.25 value for deciduous or tropical woodland (Jenkinson et al., 1992; Coleman and Jenkinson, 1995) . Three sets of simulation runs were made: one with all decomposition rate constants set to the values fixed by the model authors (Coleman and Jenkinson, 1995) ; one with the DPM:RPM ratio set to 2.33 instead of the above-mentioned 0.82 value and all other rate constants and parameters left unchanged; and a third one with all decomposition rate constants doubled and all other parameters as set by the model authors.",

This was done by running the model first for the 5 years preceding the start of the trial according to two extreme land-use scenarios, the rationale being that type and quantity of organic matter entering the soil during the 5 years preceding the trial, essentially control how much of the initial 15.4 Mg C ha 21 must have been in the more labile DPM and RPM pools at the start of the trial. The land-use scenarios chosen for the 5 years preceding the trial were (1) continuous cropping with annual inputs of crop and weed residues amounting to 3 Mg DM ha 21 , and (2) grass fallow with annual inputs of 12 Mg DM ha 21 . The remaining C in the initial 15.4 Mg C ha 21 (the C that is not inert, and that did not enter the soil in the 5 years preceding the trial) was then allocated to the HUM and BIO pools according to a 1.0:0.003 ratio (a ratio representing a microbial biomass population in equilibrium with a decomposing HUM fraction according to the model rate constants). The size of the IOM pool, the inert SOC, was estimated with the regression equation proposed by Falloon et al. (1998) , which predicts an IOM pool size of 1.1 Mg C ha 21 for a SOC level of 15.4 Mg C ha 21 . To account for uncertainty on this estimate, simulations were done for two IOM sizes (0.3 and 5.0 Mg C ha 21 ), being the 95% confidence interval around the regression equation estimate.",

Moreover, d 13 C values of weeds varied between the seven weeding operations because of pronounced seasonal shifts in weed composition (proportion of C 3 and C 4 weeds) as discussed by Diels et al.

Land use intensity has pronounced effects on SOC contents, and natural and planted fallows, including grass fallows, are known to be an effective way to restore SOC stocks (Lal and Kang, 1982) , because of the combined effect of the permanent soil cover, high returns of OM, and absence of tillage.",

First, the data in Table 1 show that the crop residues indeed constitute an important source of OM but that there is little scope to further increase this by using mineral fertilizer. In the no-tree control treatments the SOC contents in the top soil dropped from the initial 15.4 to 8.5 -8.9 Mg C ha 21 in 11 years (Table 3 ), irrespective of whether fertilizer was added or not. The fertilizer application did not affect cowpea biomass, did increase maize grain yield but had little effect on maize stover yield, and decreased weed biomass (Table 1 ). In the AC treatments, SOC levels tended to be slightly higher when fertilizer was applied (Table 3 ), presumably because the fertilizer did increase the OM production to some extent in these treatments (Table 1 ).",

Compared to the no-tree control treatments, an annual application of an additional 8.5 Mg DM ha 21 in the AC treatments, mainly produced by the legume trees, led to an extra 3.5 Mg C ha 21 (, 0.2% C) in the equivalent soil mass after 11 years, and 4.1 Mg C ha 21 after 16 years (Table 3 ). The difference is small compared to SOC buildup under fallow vegetation, reported to be 21 Mg C ha 21 in 10 years of bush regrowth on a slightly more humid site (1470 mm yr 21 ) in SW Nigeria (Aweto, 1981) . This suggests that, for this environment, keeping part of the land under permanent fallow and concentrating production on the rest of the land might be a more effective way than AC to store or maintain C stocks in the soil as a way to reduce CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. However, the extra SOC in the AC systems is important for the maintenance of soil fertility: After 10 years the ECEC of the 0 -5 cm top soil averaged 4.5 cmol c kg 21 in the AC systems compared to an average 3.3 cmol c kg 21 in the two control systems (Vanlauwe et al., 2004) . The ECEC of the mineral fraction in the topsoil (9% clay, mainly kaolinite) was 1.0 cmol c kg 21 soil only, which underscores the importance of SOM for building the cation exchange capacity in this soil. Trees are an interesting option for producing extra organic matter because they can capture additional light and moisture not available to the crop, provided competition with the crops is avoided by proper separation in space or time. Expressed as a percentage of the total tree biomass (excluding wood) produced in a year, the biomass pruned at maize planting (first pruning in a year) amounted to 37% of the annual Leucaena biomass and 57% of the annual Senna biomass. This fraction of the biomass was almost entirely produced outside the cropping season using residual soil moisture and the erratic rainfall at the beginning and the end of the dry season.",

As less OM is produced in the Senna AC system (Table 1 ) compared to the Leucaena system, the model thus predicts a 1.9 Mg C ha 21 lower SOC buildup in the Senna system in 2002 (Table 5 ). However, we observed that the buildup was 1.2 ^1.6 Mg C ha 21 higher in Senna instead of being lower (Table 3 ), so the quality effect amounted to 1.9 \u00fe (1.2 ^1.6) \u00bc 3.1 ^1.6 Mg C ha 21 .",

The present study demonstrated that the 13 C natural abundance technique is also useful for complex systems involving rotation and intercropping of different C 3 and C 4 plant species. When comparing experimental errors relative to treatment contrasts, d 13 C values were more precise and thus offered a more stringent test to the model than carbon contents (Table 3 ). Moreover, the total carbon and d 13 C value had a different sensitivity to the buildup of C 4 -carbon, and thus offered complementary information. This is because the old carbon remaining at the end of the trial was mainly of C 3 -origin. Calculations with Eq. ( 2) show that small changes in the quantities of C 4 carbon retained in the soil had a clear effect on the d 13 C values, whereas its effect on total carbon contents was masked by experimental errors. This was especially the case in the no-tree control treatments where the buildup of new carbon is relatively small and an extra 1 Mg C ha 21 of C 4 -origin, not statistically detectable in the total SOC level, raises the d 13 C value by 0.9\u2030 after 11 years.",

Such priming effects are not considered in the ROTHC-26.3 model, as is the case for most SOM models (Kuzyakov et al., 2000) . So the model predicted that the 'old' SOC decomposed at the same rate in all treatments, and we thus validated the model with this inherent assumption by comparing simulated and predicted contrasts of SOC contents and 13 C abundances between treatments. When examining the effect of fertilizer on observed (Table 3 ) and simulated (Table 5 ) SOC contents, we found no indications that fertilizer increased SOM turnover. However, it cannot be excluded that the high-quality residues from the legume trees and/or rhizodeposition from the tree roots accelerated the turnover of the old C compared to the control plots. Some laboratory incubation studies with 13 C or 14 C labeled residues indicate that the addition of easily decomposable OM to soil might double or even triple the mineralization of the soil C (Broadbent, 1947; Vanlauwe et al., 1994; Liang et al., 1999) . In a field incubation study with soil sampled from the control plot in the Ibadan long-term experiment, it was indeed observed that several legume residue types increased the decomposition of the native SOC soil carbon (K. Oorts, PhD thesis 539, K.U. Leuven). Unfortunately, there is little information about the extent to which such C-priming occurs in the field in the longer term.",

                "text": "Another reason for the fast decomposition might be the low physical protection of SOM in this sandy topsoil (9% clay, predominantly kaolinite). The effect of physical protection by clay is accounted for in the model by making the partition between CO 2 evolved and (BIO \u00fe HUM) formed during decomposition dependent on the inorganic cation exchange capacity (CEC min ) based on the relationship derived from observations over the first 10 days in S\u00f8rensen's (1975) laboratory experiment with labeled cellulose. Quantitative information on the effect of clay content and type (or CEC) on long-term SOC dynamics are, however, scarce and variable. Decomposition studies in the field with labeled residues demonstrated that retention after 8 years in southern Australia and after 10 years in England was between 5 and 40% higher in heavier textured soils than in lighter textured soils (Jenkinson, 1977; Ladd et al., 1985) . The part in the ROTHC model dealing with the later stages of decomposition has been parameterized exclusively on data from experiments in Rothamsted (Jenkinson et al., 1992) on sites having high-activity clays and fairly high clay contents. Therefore, underestimation of the textural control effect on SOM stabilization could explain why the model underestimates the SOC decomposition rate for this sandy topsoil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type. If the textural control mechanism is indeed so much weaker in this soil, it would mean that SOM buildup is most difficult in those soils where SOM is most needed in order to attain sufficient cation exchange capacity.",

The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where SOC levels dropped from the initial 15.4 to 7.3-8.0 Mg C ha 21 in 16 years (SOC content in 1700 Mg ha 21 equivalent soil mass). In the two continuously cropped AC systems (Leucaena and Senna), the SOC levels dropped to levels between 10.7 and 13.2 Mg C ha 21 . 2. The addition of mineral fertilizer (NPK) had little effect on the quantities of plant residues returned to the soil (sum of weeds, crop residues, and tree prunings), and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of SOC decomposition. 3. The 13 C natural abundance technique yielded useful information to test SOM models in a complex cropping system, in which both C 3 and C 4 plants were intercropped/rotated, and contrasts in the d 13 C of the SOC resulted from the fact that the relative OM contribution of the C 3 and C 4 components differed between the treatments compared. 4. The fact that we had to double the decomposition rate constants of the ROTHC-26.3 model in order to reproduce the observed contrasts in SOC contents and 13 C abundance between the AC systems and the control without trees indicated that SOC decomposition in this experiment was very fast. Possible reasons for this are (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction in the sandy top soil, in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type, was lower than assumed by the model. Termite activity could also have contributed to the seemingly fast decomposition.",
